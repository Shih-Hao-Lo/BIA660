Jon Degenhardt:Surya Kallumadi:Utkarsh Porwal:Andrew Trotman	eCommerce Information Retrieval is receiving increasing attention in the academic literature, and is an essential component of some of the largest web sites (such as eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, Taobao, Target, Facebook, Home Depot, and others). These kinds of organisations clearly value the importance of research into Information Retrieval. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, to set a research agenda, to examine how to build data sets, and how evaluate algorithms for research into this fascinating topic. eCommerce IR is ripe for research and has a unique set of problems. For example, in eCommerce search there may be no hypertext links between documents (products); there is a click stream, but more importantly, there is often a buy stream. eCommerce problems are wide in scope and range from user interaction modalities through to dynamic updates of a rapidly changing collection on auction sites, and the experienceness of some products (such as Airbnb bookings). This workshop is a follow up to very successful workshops held at SIGIR 2017 and SIGIR 2018. This year we will be running a data challenge (sponsored by eBay) which will allow us to follow up on multiple aspects that were discussed in the previous workshops (in particular, deterministic rank orders and how to evaluate these).

Alexandra Olteanu:Jean Garcia-Gathright:Maarten de Rijke:Michael D. Ekstrand	This workshop explores challenges in responsible information retrieval system development and deployment. The focus is on determining actionable research agendas on five key dimensions of responsible information retrieval: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. Rather than just a mini-conference, this workshop is an event during which participants are expected to work. The workshop brings together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in contributing to the development of a technical research agenda for responsible information retrieval.

Guillaume Bouchard:Guido Caldarelli:Vassilis Plachouras	The spread of misinformation online is a challenge that may have an impact on society by misleading and undermining the trust of people in domains such as politics or public health. While fact-checking is one way to identify misinformation, it is a slow process and requires significant effort. Improving the efficiency of fact-checking by automating parts of the process or defining new processes to validate claims is a challenging task with a need for expertise from multiple disciplines. The aim of ROME 2019 is to bring together researchers from various fields such as Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Semantic Web and Complex Networks to discuss these problems and define new directions in the area of automated fact-checking.

Dyaa Albakour:Miguel Martinez:Sylvia Tippmann:Ahmet Aker:Jonathan Stray:Shiri Dori-Hacohen:Alberto Barrón-Cedeño	The journalism industry has undergone a revolution in the past decade, leading to new opportunities as well as challenges. News consumption, production and delivery have all been affected and transformed by technology Readers require new mechanisms to cope with the vast volume of information in order to be informed about news events. Reporters have begun to use natural language processing (NLP) and (IR) techniques for investigative work. Publishers and aggregators are seeking new business models, and new ways to reach and retain their audience. A shift in business models has led to a gradual shift in styles of journalism in attempts to increase page views; and, far more concerning, to real mis- and dis-information, alongside allegations of "fake news" threatening the journalistic freedom and integrity of legitimate news outlets. Social media platforms drive viewership, creating filter bubbles and an increasingly polarized readership. News documents have always been a part of research on information access and retrieval methods. Over the last few years, the IR community has increasingly recognized these challenges in journalism and opened a conversation about how we might begin to address them. Evidence of this recognition is the participation in the two previous editions of our NewsIR workshop, held in ECIR 2016 and 2018. One of the most important outcomes of those workshops is an increasing awareness in the community about the changing nature of journalism and the IR challenges it entails. To move yet another step forward, the goal of the third edition of our workshop will be to create a multidisciplinary venue that brings together news experts from both technology and journalism. This would take NewsIR from a European forum targeting mainly IR researchers, into a more inclusive and influential international forum. We hope that this new format will foster further understanding for both news professionals and IR researchers, as well as producing better outcomes for news consumers. We will address the possibilities and challenges that technology offers to the journalists, the challenges that new developments in journalism create for IR researchers, and the complexity of information access tasks for news readers.

Yongfeng Zhang:Yi Zhang:Min Zhang:Chirag Shah	Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also interpretability of the models or explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc. This is even more important in personalized search and recommendation scenarios, where users would like to know why a particular product, web page, news report, or friend suggestion exists in his or her own search and recommendation lists. The workshop focuses on the research and application of explainable recommendation, search, and a broader scope of IR tasks. It will gather researchers as well as practitioners in the field for discussions, idea communications, and research promotions. It will also generate insightful debates about the recent regulations regarding AI interpretability, to a broader community including but not limited to IR, machine learning, AI, Data Science, and beyond.

Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran:Philipp Mayr:Michihiro Yasunaga:Dayne Freitag:Dragomir Radev:Min-Yen Kan	The deluge of scholarly publication poses a challenge for scholars find relevant research and policy makers to seek in-depth information and understand research impact. Information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP) and bibliometrics could enhance scholarly search, retrieval and user experience, but their use in digital libraries is not widespread. To address this gap, we propose the 4th Joint Workshop on BIRNDL and the 5th CL-SciSumm Shared Task. We seek to foster collaboration among researchers in NLP, IR and Digital Libraries (DL), and to stimulate the development of new methods in NLP, IR, recommendation systems and scientometrics toward improved scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale.

Benyou Wang	This doctoral research project investigates using Quantum Theory (QT) to represent language, especially in some dynamic scenarios, e.g. when dealing with dynamic corpora or interactive tasks. The author plans to propose a quantum state driven framework for language problems and generalize it in a high-dimensional tensor space. Dynamics will be modeled by the formalism thereof of quantum evolution governing the update of quantum states. The author argues that this proposal will pave the way towards a new paradigm which may provide some novel insights about how to represent the language and its evolution in dynamic scenarios.

Jiqun Liu	Stage is an essential facet of task. At different stages of search, users' search strategies are often influenced by different search intentions, encountered problems, as well as knowledge states. In previous studies, information seeking and interactive IR researchers have developed and validated some frameworks for describing various task facets and features. However, few studies have explored how to depict and differentiate different stages or states of complex search tasks in a comprehensive, multidimensional manner. The existing theoretical models of search process offer limited contributions to search path evaluation and the design of system recommendations for users at different states. To address this issue at both theoretical and empirical levels, my dissertation aims to construct an explainable framework that can characterize the stages or states of complex search tasks over multiple dimensions and to apply the framework in proactive search path evaluation and recommendation.

Gregory Goren	The adversarial retrieval setting over the Web entails many challenges. Some of these are due to, essentially, ranking competitions between document authors who modify them in response to rankings induced for queries of interest so as to rank-promote the documents. One unwarranted consequence is that rankings can rapidly change due to small, almost indiscernible changes, of documents. In recent work, we addressed the issue of ranking robustness under (adversarial) document manipulations for feature-based learning-to-rank approaches. We presented a formalism of different notions of ranking robustness that gave rise to a few theoretical findings. Empirical evaluation provided support to these findings. Our next goals are to devise learning-to-rank techniques for optimizing relevance and robustness simultaneously, study the connections between ranking robustness and fairness, and to devise additional testbeds for evaluating ranking robustness.

Rashmi Sankepally	Events are an integral part of our day-to-day search needs. Users search for various kinds of events such as political events, organizational announcements, policy changes, personal events, criminal activity and so on. In linguistics, events are often thought of as discourse entities with associated complex structure and attributes. Many professionals look for patterns that involve event occurrences. Journalists, financial analysts, intelligence analysts, attorneys conducting investigations, auditors examining corporate records are examples of users who may want to find such information and to arrange it in ways that can help to produce meaningful analyses. The goal of this work is to develop effective information retrieval systems that can help users to satisfy event-related information needs. My particular interest is in events that are decomposable into subevents in ways that can be anticipated. I am interested in modeling decomposable events, and in automatically recognizing references to subevents, both to help with finding relevant documents and to help with presenting diverse results to the user. I plan to pursue this broader goal in three stages, each of which involves creating a test collection. I have started by developing information retrieval test collections for news, building on existing collections of news stories from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) and the Topic Detection and Tracking Evaluations [1]. Next, I plan to build a new event ontology for email, and use that ontology as a basis for building an information retrieval collection from the Avocado Email collection. Finally, I plan to extend one or both of these test collections to support research on characterizing event impact, thus perhaps providing an additional basis for ranking. In each stage of my work, new test collection(s) will enable new research. In my first stage, which is in progress, I have studied the effect of automatically detected subevents on ranking effectiveness. Using the Rich Entities, Relations and Events (ERE) ontology of event types and subtypes from the TAC Event track [5], and two existing automated event detection systems, I have developed a simple bag of words-and-events search system that uses the automatically detected event type information. I also built an information retrieval test collection from a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) collection, for which event-based topics exist. Evaluation results show promise when compared to baseline approaches. I plan to further develop this line of work to identify ways to automatically decompose high level events into their components. With the goal of extending the event retrieval work to an organizational setting, in my second line of research I plan to work with the Avocado email collection [3]. While newswire text and other Web pages are easily available for everyone's perusal, email content is interesting because it may contain organizational and personal events that differ from those found in news, and those events may be referred to in less fully contextualized ways. In this line of research, I want to build a retrieval system for events in this genre of personal and organizational content. The retrieval system will provide a diverse ranking covering the full range of subevents for which information is available. To do this, I will need a reusable test collection containing event-related topics, with the event nuggets within those documents annotated for relevance. This annotation at the event nugget level will support computing measures like α-nDCG [2] in which the gain reflects in part the number of different event nuggets in a document. The third stage of my work will be more exploratory, since there are many ways in which one might conceptualize event impact. My initial approach will be to explore alternative indicators for different types of impact. For example, the societal impact of news stories might be characterized by the number of readers, whereas the personal impact of an email might be characterized by the time before a reply is received. I am particularly interested in how sentiment analysis might be used to characterize event impact, particularly with reference to publicly available user-generated content.

Hawre Hosseini	Linking phrases to knowledge base entities is a process known as entity linking and has already been widely explored for various content types such as tweets. A major step in entity linking is to recognize and/or classify phrases that can be disambiguated and linked to knowledge base entities, i.e., Named Entity Recognition and Classification. Unlike common entity recognition and linking systems, however, we aim to recognize, classify, and link entities which are implicitly mentioned, and hence lack a surface form, to appropriate knowledge base entries. In other words, the objective of our work is to recognize and identify core entities of a tweet when those entities are not explicitly mentioned; this process is referred to as Implicit Named Entity Recognition and Linking.

Priya Deshpande	Digitized world demands data integration systems that combine data repositories from multiple data sources. Vast amounts of clinical and biomedical research data are considered a primary force enabling data-driven research toward advancing health research and for introducing efficiencies in healthcare delivery. Data-driven research may have many goals, including but not limited to improved diagnostics processes, novel biomedical discoveries, epidemiology, and education. However, finding and gaining access to relevant data remains an elusive goal. We identified these challenges and developed an Integrated Radiology Image Search (IRIS) framework that could be a step toward aiding data-driven research. We propose building data bridges to support retrieving ranked relevant documents from integrated repository. My research focuses on biomedical data integration and indexing systems and provide ranked document retrieval from an integrated repository. Though we currently focus on integrating biomedical data sources (for medical professionals), we believe that our proposed framework and methodologies can be used in other domains as well.

Binsheng Liu	Thinking in terms of an information need instead of simply queries provides a rich set of new opportunities in improving the effectiveness of search [6]. User queries may vary a lot for a single information need [3, 9], as a query is often under-specified. Many techniques have been proposed to enrich a single query, for example relevance modeling [8]. These techniques focus on improving overall system performance but may fail in some occasions. Instead of optimizing for a single query, another direction is to use multiple query variations to represent an information need. With fusion techniques, query variations can improve system performance while failing fewer queries [2, 6]. Using query variations is a simple and appealing idea, but collecting them is a manually intensive task. Existing high quality query variations are collected from crowd-sourcing workers and domain experts [1]. Therefore the process cannot be automated and deployed in a production system. Researchers have investigated random walks on click graphs [5] and relevance models [4] to automatically generate query variations, but experiments show that there is still a big gap between automatic variations and human generated ones. In this PhD project,we focus on automatic query variation generation and try to reduce the gap to human generated variations.We plan to leverage advances of transfer learning and classic relevance modeling to generate high quality query variations to improve system performance.

Qiuchi Li	Language understanding is multimodal. During human communication, messages are conveyed not only by words in textual form, but also through speech patterns, gestures or facial emotions of the speakers. Therefore, it is crucial to fuse information from different modalities to achieve a joint comprehension. With the rapid progress in the deep learning field, neural networks have emerged as the most popular approach for addressing multimodal data fusion [1, 6, 7, 12]. While these models can effectively combine multimodal features by learning from data, they nevertheless lack an explicit exhibition of how different modalities are related to each other, due to the inherent low interpretability of neural networks [2]. In the meantime, Quantum Theory (QT) has given rise to principled approaches for incorporating interactions between textual features into a holistic textual representation [3, 5, 8, 10], where the concepts of superposition andentanglement have been universally exploited to formulate interactions. The advantages of those models in capturing complicated correlations between textual features have been observed. We hereby propose the research on quantum-inspired multimodal data fusion, claiming that the limitation of multimodal data fusion can be tackled by quantum-driven models. In particular, we propose to employ superposition to formulate intra-modal interactions while the interplay between different modalities is expected to be captured by entanglement measures. By doing so, the interactions within multimodal data may be rendered explicitly in a unified quantum formalism, increasing the performance and interpretability for concrete multimodal tasks. It will also expand the application domains of quantum theory to multimodal tasks where only preliminary efforts have been made [11]. We therefore aim at answering the following research question: RQ. Can we fuse multimodal data with quantum-inspired models? To answer this question, we propose to fuse multimodal data with complex-valued neural networks, motivated by the theoretical link between neural networks and quantum theory [4] and advances in complex-valued neural networks [9]. Our model begins with a separate complex-valued embedding learned for each unimodal data based on the existing works [5, 10] which inherently assumes superposition between intra-modal features. Then we construct a many-body system in entangled state for multimodal data, where cross-modality interactions are naturally reflected by entanglement measures. Quantum measurement operators are applied to the entanglement state to address a concrete multimodal task at hand. The whole process is instrumented by a complex-valued neural network, which is able to learn how multimodal features are combined from data, and at the same time explain the combination by means of quantum superposition and entanglement measures. We plan to examine our proposed models on CMU-MOSI [12] and CMU-MOSEI [1] which are benchmarking multimodal sentiment analysis datasets. The dataset targets at classifying sentiment into 2, 5 or 7 classes with the input of textual, visual and acoustic features. We expect to see comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art models, and we will explore superposition and entanglement measures to better understand the inter-modal interactions.

Marco Wrzalik	Visualization of inter-document similarities is widely used for the exploration of document collections and interactive retrieval. However, similarity relationships between documents are multifaceted and measured distances by a given metric often do not match the perceived similarity of human beings. Furthermore, the user's notion of similarity can drastically change with the exploration objective or task at hand. Therefore, this research proposes to investigate online adjustments to the similarity model using feedback generated during exploration or exploratory search. In this course, rich visualizations and interactions will support users to give valuable feedback. Based on this, metric learning methodologies will be applied to adjust a similarity model in order to improve the exploration experience. At the same time, trained models are considered as valuable outcomes whose benefits for similarity-based tasks such as query-by-example retrieval or classification will be tested.

Alfan Farizki Wicaksono	Users of online job search websites interact with ranked lists of job summaries generated in response to queries, hoping to identify one or more jobs of interest. Hence, the quality of job search rankings becomes a primary factor that affects user satisfaction. In this work, we propose methodologies and measures for evaluating the quality of job search rankings from a user modeling perspective. We start by investigating job seekers' behavior when they are interacting with the generated rankings, leveraging job search interaction logs from Seek.com, a well-known Australasian job search website. The output of this investigation will be an accurate model of job seekers that will be incorporated into an effectiveness metric. Recent proposals for job search ranking models used using two types of metrics to evaluate the quality of the ranking generated by the models: (1) offline metrics, such as [email protected] (k is set to the number of job summaries shown in the first page), [email protected], or Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR); and (2) online metrics, such as click-through rate and job application rate [3, 6].

Souvick Ghosh	Recent developments in conversational IR have raised questions about the nature of interactions which occur between the user and the system and the cognitive capabilities expected of such systems. In our research, we investigate the completeness of existing theoretical frameworks in explaining conversational search data propose modifications to such systems. The linear and transient nature of speech makes it cognitively challenging for the user to process a large amount of information. We propose a study to evaluate the users' preference of modalities when using conversational search systems. The study will help us to understand how results should be presented in a conversational search system. As we observe how users search using audio queries, interact with the intermediary, and process the results presented, we aim to develop an insight on how to present results more efficiently in a conversational search setting. We also plan on exploring the effectiveness and consistency of different media in a conversational search setting. Our observations will inform future designs and help to create a better understanding of such systems.	Informing the Design of Conversational IR Systems: Framework and Result Presentation	NA	2018

Risk-sensitive evaluation tools are designed to address that task, but, they currently do not support inference over multiple baselines. Our research objectives are to: 1) Survey and revisit risk evaluation, taking into account frequentist and Bayesian inference approaches for comparing against multiple baselines; 2) Apply that new approach, evaluating a novel web search technique that leverages previously run queries to improve the effectiveness of a new user query; and 3) Explore how risk-sensitive component interactions affect end-to-end effectiveness in a search pipeline.

Markus Zlabinger	The most commonly used active learning criterion is uncertainty sampling, where a supervised model is used to predict uncertain samples that should be labeled next by a human annotator. When using active learning, two problems are encountered: First, the supervised model has a cold-start problem in the beginning of the active learning process, and second, the human annotators might make labeling mistakes. In my Ph.D. research, I address the two problems with the development of an unsupervised method for the computation of informative samples. The informative samples are first manually labeled and then used for both: The training of the initial active learning model and the training of the human annotators in form of a learning-by-doing session. The planned unsupervised method will be based on word-embeddings and it will be limited to the area of text classification.	Efficient and Effective Text-Annotation through Active Learning	NA	2018

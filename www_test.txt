Mengfan Yao:Charalampos Chelmis:Daphney-Stavroula Zois	The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data–driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well–defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Existing work has focused on harassment (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, two key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) timeliness: the state–of–the–art relies on a fixed set of features learned during training for offline detection (i.e., after all correspondence has become available), hindering the ability to respond in a timely manner (i.e., as soon as possible) to cyberbullying events. (ii) scalabilty: the scalability of existing methods to the staggering rates at which content is generated (e.g., 95 million photos and videos are shared on Instagram per day1) has largely remained unaddressed. In my lightning talk, I will introduce CONcISE, a novel approach for timely and accurate Cyberbullying detectiON on Instagram media SEssions, that has been accepted for presentation at the main conference [1]. Specifically, I will present a novel two–stage online approach (illustrated in Figure 1) designed to reduce the time to raise a cyberbullying alert by (i) sequentially examining comments as they become available over time, and (ii) minimizing the number of feature evaluations necessary for a decision to be made for each comment. By formalizing the problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem, a novel algorithm has been developed that satisfies four key properties: accuracy, repetitiveness, timeliness, and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a real–world Instagram dataset with ∼ 4M users and ∼ 10M comments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to accuracy, timeliness, efficiency, and robustness, and show that it consistently outperforms the stat–of–the–art, often by a considerable margin.

Xinyi Zhou:Reza Zafarani	The explosive growth of fake news and its erosion to democracy, journalism and economy has increased the demand for fake news detection. To achieve efficient and explainable fake news detection, an interdisciplinary approach is required, relying on scientific contributions from various disciplines, e.g., social sciences, engineering, among others. Here, we illustrate how such multidisciplinary contributions can help detect fake news by improving feature engineering, or by providing well-justified machine learning models. We demonstrate how news content, news propagation patterns, and users’ engagements with news can help detect fake news.	Fake News Detection: An Interdisciplinary Research	NA:NA	2018
Omar Alonso	Many data intensive applications that use machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques depend on humans providing the initial dataset, enabling algorithms to process the rest or for other humans to evaluate the performance of such algorithms. There are, however, practical issues with the adoption of human computation and crowdsourcing at scale in the real world. Building systems data processing pipelines that require crowd computing remains difficult. In this tutorial, we present practical considerations for designing and implementing tasks that require the use of humans and machines in combination with the goal of producing high quality labels.

Lora Aroyo:Anca Dumitrache:Oana Inel:Zoltán Szlávik:Benjamin Timmermans:Chris Welty	In this tutorial, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing methodology called CrowdTruth [1, 9]. The central characteristic of CrowdTruth is harnessing the diversity in human interpretation to capture the wide range of opinions and perspectives, and thus provide more reliable, realistic and inclusive real-world annotated data for training and evaluating machine learning components. Unlike other methods, we do not discard dissenting votes, but incorporate them into a richer and more continuous representation of truth. CrowdTruth is a widely used crowdsourcing methodology1 adopted by industrial partners and public organizations such as Google, IBM, New York Times, Cleveland Clinic, Crowdynews, Sound and Vision archive, Rijksmuseum, and in a multitude of domains such as AI, news, medicine, social media, cultural heritage, and social sciences. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the audience to a novel approach to crowdsourcing that takes advantage of the diversity of opinions and perspectives that is inherent to the Web, as methods that deal with disagreement and diversity in crowdsourcing have become increasingly popular. Creating this more complex notion of truth contributes directly to the larger discussion on how to make the Web more reliable, diverse and inclusive.

Ricardo Baeza-Yates:Sharad Goel	Machine learning algorithms increasingly affect both our online and offline experiences. Researchers and policymakers, however, have rightfully raised concerns that these systems might inadvertently exacerbate societal biases. We provide an introduction to fair machine learning, beginning with a general overview of algorithmic fairness, and then discussing these issues specifically in the context of the Web. To measure and mitigate potential bias from machine learning systems, there has recently been an explosion of competing mathematical definitions of what it means for an algorithm to be fair. Unfortunately, as we show, many of the most prominent definitions of fairness suffer from subtle shortcomings that can lead to serious adverse consequences when used as an objective. To illustrate these complications, we draw on a variety of classical and modern ideas from statistics, economics, and legal theory. We further discuss the equity of machine learning algorithms in the specific context of the Web, focusing on search engines and e-commerce websites. We expose the different sources for bias on the Web and how they impact fairness. They include not only data bias, but also biases that are produced by data sampling, the algorithms per-se, user interaction and feedback loops that result from user personalization and content creation. All these lead to a vicious cycle that affects everybody. The content of this tutorial is mainly based in the work of the authors [1,2,3,4].	Designing Equitable Algorithms for the Web	NA:NA	2018
Sarah Bird:Ben Hutchinson:Krishnaram Kenthapadi:Emre Kıcıman:Margaret Mitchell	Researchers and practitioners from different disciplines have highlighted the ethical and legal challenges posed by the use of machine learned models and data-driven systems, and the potential for such systems to discriminate against certain population groups, due to biases in algorithmic decision-making systems. This tutorial aims to present an overview of algorithmic bias / discrimination issues observed over the last few years and the lessons learned, key regulations and laws, and evolution of techniques for achieving fairness in machine learning systems. We will motivate the need for adopting a “fairness-first” approach (as opposed to viewing algorithmic bias / fairness considerations as an afterthought), when developing machine learning based models and systems for different consumer and enterprise applications. Then, we will focus on the application of fairness-aware machine learning techniques in practice, by highlighting industry best practices and case studies from different technology companies. Based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research challenges for the data mining / machine learning community.

Somit Gupta:Ronny Kohavi:Alex Deng:Jeff Omhover:Pawel Janowski	The Internet and the general digitalization of products and operations provides an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate innovation while applying a rigorous and trustworthy methodology for supporting key product decisions. Developers of connected software, including web sites, applications, and devices, can now evaluate ideas quickly and accurately using controlled experiments, also known as A/B tests. From front-end user-interface changes to backend algorithms, from search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo!) to retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Etsy) to social networking services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) to travel services (e.g., Expedia, Airbnb, Booking.com) to many startups, online controlled experiments are now utilized to make data-driven decisions at a wide range of companies. The theory of a controlled experiment is simple, but for the practitioner the deployment and evaluation of online controlled experiments at scale (100’s of concurrently running experiments) across a variety of web sites, mobile apps, and desktop applications presents many pitfalls and new research challenges. In this tutorial, we will introduce the overall A/B testing methodology, walkthrough use cases using real examples, and then focus on practical and research challenges in scaling experimentation. We will share key lessons learned from scaling experimentation at Microsoft to thousands of experiments per year and outline promising directions for future work.

Krishna P. Gummadi:Hoda Heidari	Machine Learning is increasingly employed to make consequential decisions for humans. In response to the ethical issues that may ensue, an active area of research in ML has been dedicated to the study of algorithmic unfairness. This tutorial introduces fair-ML to the web conference community and offers a new perspective on it through the lens of the long-established economic theories of distributive justice. Based on our past and ongoing research, we argue that economic theories of equality of opportunity, inequality measurement, and social choice have a lot to offer—in terms of tools and insights—to data scientists and practitioners interested in understanding the ethical implications of their work. We overview these theories and discuss their connections to fair-ML.	Economic Theories of Distributive Justice for Fair Machine Learning	NA:NA	2018
Liangjie Hong:Mounia Lalmas	User engagement plays a central role in companies operating online services, such as search engines, news portals, e-commerce sites, entertainment services, and social networks. A main challenge is to leverage collected knowledge about the daily online behavior of millions of users to understand what engage them short-term and more importantly long-term. Two critical steps of improving user engagement are metrics and their optimization. The most common way that engagement is measured is through various online metrics, acting as proxy measures of user engagement. This tutorial will review these metrics, their advantages and drawbacks, and their appropriateness to various types of online services. Once metrics are defined, how to optimize them will become the key issue. We will survey methodologies including machine learning models and experimental designs that are utilized to optimize these metrics via direct or indirect ways. As case studies, we will focus on four types of services, news, search, entertainment, and e-commerce. We will end with lessons learned and a discussion on the most promising research directions.

Rushed Kanawati:Martin Atzmueller	In the field of web mining and web science, as well as data science and data mining there has been a lot of interest in the analysis of (social) networks. With the growing complexity of heterogeneous data, feature-rich networks have emerged as a powerful modeling approach: They capture data and knowledge at different scales from multiple heterogeneous data sources, and allow the mining and analysis from different perspectives. The challenge is to devise novel algorithms and tools for the analysis of such networks. This tutorial provides a unified perspective on feature-rich networks, focusing on different modeling approaches, in particular multiplex and attributed networks. It outlines important principles, methods, tools and future research directions in this emerging field.	Modeling and Mining Feature-Rich Networks	NA:NA	2018
Krishnaram Kenthapadi:Ilya Mironov:Abhradeep Thakurta	Preserving privacy of users is a key requirement of web-scale data mining applications and systems such as web search, recommender systems, crowdsourced platforms, and analytics applications, and has witnessed a renewed focus in light of recent data breaches and new regulations such as GDPR. In this tutorial, we will first present an overview of privacy breaches over the last two decades and the lessons learned, key regulations and laws, and evolution of privacy techniques leading to differential privacy definition / techniques. Then, we will focus on the application of privacy-preserving data mining techniques in practice, by presenting case studies such as Apple’s differential privacy deployment for iOS / macOS, Google’s RAPPOR, LinkedIn Salary, and Microsoft’s differential privacy deployment for collecting Windows telemetry. We will conclude with open problems and challenges for the data mining / machine learning community, based on our experiences in industry.	Privacy-preserving Data Mining in Industry	NA:NA:NA	2018
Luca Pappalardo:Gianni Barlacchi:Roberto Pellungrini:Filippo Simini	The inclusion of tracking technologies in personal devices opened the doors to the analysis of large sets of mobility data like GPS traces and call detail records. This tutorial presents an overview of both modeling principles of human mobility and machine learning models applicable to specific problems. We review the state of the art of five main aspects in human mobility: (1) human mobility data landscape; (2) key measures of individual and collective mobility; (3) generative models at the level of individual, population and mixture of the two; (4) next location prediction algorithms; (5) applications for social good. For each aspect, we show experiments and simulations using the Python library ”scikit-mobility” developed by the presenters of the tutorial.

Vayianos Pertsas:Panos Constantopoulos	Understanding and extracting knowledge contained in text and encoding it as linked data for the WEB is a highly complex task that poses several challenges, requiring expertise from different fields such as conceptual modeling, natural language processing and web technologies including web mining, linked data generation and publishing, etc. When it comes to the scholarly domain, the transformation of human readable research articles into machine comprehensible knowledge bases is considered of high importance and necessity today due to the explosion of scientific publications in every major discipline, that makes it increasingly difficult for experts to maintain an overview of their domain or relate ideas from different domains. This situation could be significantly alleviated by knowledge bases capable of supporting queries such as: find all papers that address a given problem; how was the problem solved; which methods are employed by whom in addressing particular tasks; etc. that currently cannot be addressed by commonly used search engines such as Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar. This tutorial addresses the above challenge by introducing the participants to methods required in order to model knowledge regarding a given domain, extract information from available texts using advanced machine learning techniques, associate it with other information mined from the web in order to infer new knowledge and republish everything as linked open data on the Web. To this end, we will use a specific use case – that of the scholarly domain, and will show how to model research processes, extract them from research articles, associate them with contextual information from article metadata and other linked repositories and create knowledge bases available as linked data. Our aim is to show how methodologies from different computer science fields, namely natural language processing, machine learning and conceptual modeling, can be combined with Web technologies in a single meaningful workflow.

Massimo Quadrana:Dietmar Jannach:Paolo Cremonesi	Recommender systems are widely used in online applications to help users find items of interest and help them deal with information overload. In this tutorial, we discuss the class of sequence-aware recommender systems. Differently from the traditional problem formulation based on a user-item rating matrix, the input to such systems is a sequence of logged user interactions. Likewise, sequence-aware recommender systems implement alternative computational tasks, such as predicting the next items a user will be interested in an ongoing session or creating entire sequences of items to present to the user. We propose a problem formulation, sketch a number of computational tasks, review existing algorithmic approaches, and finally discuss evaluation aspects of sequence-aware recommender systems.

Comandur Seshadhri:Srikanta Tirthapura	Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem in graph analysis that finds use in a wide array of applications. The basic problem is to count or approximate the occurrences of a small subgraph (the pattern) in a large graph (the dataset). Subgraph counting is a computationally challenging problem, and the last few years have seen a rich literature develop around scalable solutions for it. However, these results have thus far appeared as a disconnected set of ideas that are applied separately by different research groups. We observe that there are a few common algorithmic building blocks that most subgraph counting results build on. In this tutorial, we attempt to summarize current methods through distilling these basic algorithmic building blocks. The tutorial will also cover methods for subgraph analysis on “big data” computational models such as the streaming model and models of parallel and distributed computation.

Omprakash Sonie:Muthusamy Chelliah:Shamik Sural	Deep Learning has shown significant results in various domains. In this tutorial, we provide conceptual understanding of embedding methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We present fashion use case and apply these techniques for modeling image, text as well as sequence data to figure out user profiles, give personalized recommendations tailored to changing user taste and interest. Given the image of a fashion item, recommending complementary matches is a challenge. Users’ taste evolves over time and depends on persona. Humans relate objects based on their appearance and non-visual factors of lifestyle merchandise which further complicate recommendation task. Composing outfits in addition necessitates constituent items to be compatible - similar in some but different in other aspects.	Concept to Code: Deep Learning for Fashion Recommendation	NA:NA:NA	2018

Erik Wilde:Mike Amundsen	The Web as the world’s largest information system has largely settled on a solid foundation of HTTP-based connectivity, and the representation of User Interface (UI) information resources through a mix of HTML and scripting. In contrast, the similarly rapidly evolving “Web of Services” is still based on a more diverse and more quickly evolving set of approaches and technologies. This can make architectural decisions harder when it comes to choosing on how to expose information and services through an Application Programming Interface (API). This challenge becomes even more pronounced when organizations are faced with developing strategies for managing constantly growing and evolving API landscapes. This tutorial takes participants through two different journeys. The first one is a journey discussing API styles and API technologies, comparing and contrasting them as a way to highlight the fact that there is no such thing as the one best choice. The goal of this first journey is to provide an overview of how APIs are used nowadays in research and in industry. The second journey discusses the question of how to define an API strategy, which focuses both on helping teams to make effective choices about APIs in a given context, and on how to manage that context over time when large organizations nowadays have thousands of APIs, which will continue to evolve constantly.

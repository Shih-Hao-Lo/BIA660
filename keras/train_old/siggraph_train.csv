Arnaud:Derek Nowrouzezahrai:Jean-François Lalonde:Felix Heide,"Nearly every commodity imaging system we directly interact with, or indirectly rely on, leverages power efficient, application-adjustable black-box hardware image signal processing (ISPs) units, running either in dedicated hardware blocks, or as proprietary software modules on programmable hardware. The configuration parameters of these black-box ISPs often have complex interactions with the output image, and must be adjusted prior to deployment according to application-specific quality and performance metrics. Today, this search is commonly performed manually by ""golden eye"" experts or algorithm developers leveraging domain expertise. We present a fully automatic system to optimize the parameters of black-box hardware and software image processing pipelines according to any arbitrary (i.e., application-specific) metric. We leverage a differentiable mapping between the configuration space and evaluation metrics, parameterized by a convolutional neural network that we train in an end-to-end fashion with imaging hardware in-the-loop. Unlike prior art, our differentiable proxies allow for high-dimension parameter search with stochastic first-order optimizers, without explicitly modeling any lower-level image processing transformations. As such, we can efficiently optimize black-box image processing pipelines for a variety of imaging applications, reducing application-specific configuration times from months to hours. Our optimization method is fully automatic, even with black-box hardware in the loop. We validate our method on experimental data for real-time display applications, object detection, and extreme low-light imaging. The proposed approach outperforms manual search qualitatively and quantitatively for all domain-specific applications tested. When applied to traditional denoisers, we demonstrate that---just by changing hyperparameters---traditional algorithms can outperform recent deep learning methods by a substantial margin on recent benchmarks.",Hyperparameter optimization in black-box image processing using differentiable proxies,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Bartlomiej Wronski:Ignacio Garcia-Dorado:Manfred Ernst:Damien Kelly:Michael Krainin:Chia-Kai Liang:Marc Levoy:Peyman Milanfar,"Compared to DSLR cameras, smartphone cameras have smaller sensors, which limits their spatial resolution; smaller apertures, which limits their light gathering ability; and smaller pixels, which reduces their signal-to-noise ratio. The use of color filter arrays (CFAs) requires demosaicing, which further degrades resolution. In this paper, we supplant the use of traditional demosaicing in single-frame and burst photography pipelines with a multiframe super-resolution algorithm that creates a complete RGB image directly from a burst of CFA raw images. We harness natural hand tremor, typical in handheld photography, to acquire a burst of raw frames with small offsets. These frames are then aligned and merged to form a single image with red, green, and blue values at every pixel site. This approach, which includes no explicit demosaicing step, serves to both increase image resolution and boost signal to noise ratio. Our algorithm is robust to challenging scene conditions: local motion, occlusion, or scene changes. It runs at 100 milliseconds per 12-megapixel RAW input burst frame on mass-produced mobile phones. Specifically, the algorithm is the basis of the Super-Res Zoom feature, as well as the default merge method in Night Sight mode (whether zooming or not) on Google's flagship phone.",Handheld multi-frame super-resolution,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

Srinivasan:Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon:Nima Khademi Kalantari:Ravi Ramamoorthi:Ren Ng:Abhishek Kar,"We present a practical and robust deep learning solution for capturing and rendering novel views of complex real world scenes for virtual exploration. Previous approaches either require intractably dense view sampling or provide little to no guidance for how users should sample views of a scene to reliably render high-quality novel views. Instead, we propose an algorithm for view synthesis from an irregular grid of sampled views that first expands each sampled view into a local light field via a multiplane image (MPI) scene representation, then renders novel views by blending adjacent local light fields. We extend traditional plenoptic sampling theory to derive a bound that specifies precisely how densely users should sample views of a given scene when using our algorithm. In practice, we apply this bound to capture and render views of real world scenes that achieve the perceptual quality of Nyquist rate view sampling while using up to 4000X fewer views. We demonstrate our approach's practicality with an augmented reality smart-phone app that guides users to capture input images of a scene and viewers that enable realtime virtual exploration on desktop and mobile platforms.",Local light field fusion: practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Xuaner Zhang:Kevin Matzen:Vivien Nguyen:Dillon Yao:You Zhang:Ren Ng,"In cinema, large camera lenses create beautiful shallow depth of field (DOF), but make focusing difficult and expensive. Accurate cinema focus usually relies on a script and a person to control focus in realtime. Casual videographers often crave cinematic focus, but fail to achieve it. We either sacrifice shallow DOF, as in smartphone videos; or we struggle to deliver accurate focus, as in videos from larger cameras. This paper is about a new approach in the pursuit of cinematic focus for casual videography. We present a system that synthetically renders refocusable video from a deep DOF video shot with a smartphone, and analyzes future video frames to deliver context-aware autofocus for the current frame. To create refocusable video, we extend recent machine learning methods designed for still photography, contributing a new dataset for machine training, a rendering model better suited to cinema focus, and a filtering solution for temporal coherence. To choose focus accurately for each frame, we demonstrate autofocus that looks at upcoming video frames and applies AI-assist modules such as motion, face, audio and saliency detection. We also show that autofocus benefits from machine learning and a large-scale video dataset with focus annotation, where we use our RVR-LAAF GUI to create this sizable dataset efficiently. We deliver, for example, a shallow DOF video where the autofocus transitions onto each person before she begins to speak. This is impossible for conventional camera autofocus because it would require seeing into the future.",Synthetic defocus and look-ahead autofocus for casual videography,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Davide Pellis:Martin Kilian:Felix Dellinger:Johannes Wallner:Helmut Pottmann,"Representing smooth geometric shapes by polyhedral meshes can be quite difficult in situations where the variation of edges and face normals is prominently visible. Especially problematic are saddle-shaped areas of the mesh, where typical vertices with six incident edges are ill suited to emulate the more symmetric smooth situation. The importance of a faithful discrete representation is apparent for certain special applications like freeform architecture, but is also relevant for simulation and geometric computing. In this paper we discuss what exactly is meant by a good representation of saddle points, and how this requirement is stronger than a good approximation of a surface plus its normals. We characterize good saddles in terms of the normal pyramid in a vertex. We show several ways to design meshes whose normals enjoy small variation (implying good saddle points). For this purpose we define a discrete energy of polyhedral surfaces, which is related to a certain total absolute curvature of smooth surfaces. We discuss the minimizers of both functionals and in particular show that the discrete energy is minimal not for triangle meshes, but for principal quad meshes. We demonstrate our procedures for optimization and interactive design by means of meshes intended for architectural design.",Visual smoothness of polyhedral surfaces,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Hanxiao Shen:Zhongshi Jiang:Denis Zorin:Daniele Panozzo,"Tutte embedding is one of the most common building blocks in geometry processing algorithms due to its simplicity and provable guarantees. Although provably correct in infinite precision arithmetic, it fails in challenging cases when implemented using floating point arithmetic, largely due to the induced exponential area changes. We propose Progressive Embedding, with similar theoretical guarantees to Tutte embedding, but more resilient to the rounding error of floating point arithmetic. Inspired by progressive meshes, we collapse edges on an invalid embedding to a valid, simplified mesh, then insert points back while maintaining validity. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by computing embeddings for a large collection of disk topology meshes. By combining our robust embedding with a variant of the matchmaker algorithm, we propose a general algorithm for the problem of mapping multiply connected domains with arbitrary hard constraints to the plane, with applications in texture mapping and remeshing.",Progressive embedding,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Hao-Yu Liu:Xiao-Ming Fu:Chunyang Ye:Shuangming Chai:Ligang Liu,"We present a novel algorithm to refine an input atlas with bounded packing efficiency. Central to this method is the use of the axis-aligned structure that converts the general polygon packing problem to a rectangle packing problem, which is easier to achieve high packing efficiency. Given a parameterized mesh with no flipped triangles, we propose a new angle-driven deformation strategy to transform it into a set of axis-aligned charts, which can be decomposed into rectangles by the motorcycle graph algorithm. Since motorcycle graphs are not unique, we select the one balancing the trade-off between the packing efficiency and chart boundary length, while maintaining bounded packing efficiency. The axis-aligned chart often contains greater distortion than the input, so we try to reduce the distortion while bounding the packing efficiency and retaining bijection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a data set containing over five thousand complex models. For all models, our method is able to produce packed atlases with bounded packing efficiency; for example, when the packing efficiency bound is set to 80%, we elongate the boundary length by an average of 78.7% and increase the distortion by an average of 0.0533%.

We then connect the physics governing surfaces woven out of thin ribbons to the geometry of geodesic foliations, and present a design and fabrication pipeline for approximating surfaces of arbitrary geometry and topology by triaxially-woven structures, where the ribbon layout is determined by a geodesic foliation on a sixfold branched cover of the input surface.

Reinhold Preiner:Tamy Boubekeur:Michael Wimmer,"Probabilistic distribution models like Gaussian mixtures have shown great potential for improving both the quality and speed of several geometric operators. This is largely due to their ability to model large fuzzy data using only a reduced set of atomic distributions, allowing for large compression rates at minimal information loss. We introduce a new surface model that utilizes these qualities of Gaussian mixtures for the definition and control of a parametric smooth surface. Our approach is based on an enriched mesh data structure, which describes the probability distribution of spatial surface locations around each vertex via a Gaussian covariance matrix. By incorporating this additional covariance information, we show how to define a smooth surface via a nonlinear probabilistic subdivision operator based on products of Gaussians, which is able to capture rich details at fixed control mesh resolution. This entails new applications in surface reconstruction, modeling, and geometric compression.",Gaussian-product subdivision surfaces,NA:NA:NA,2018
Yusuke Tokuyoshi:Takahiro Harada,"While bidirectional path tracing is a well-established light transport algorithm, many samples are required to obtain high-quality results for specular-diffuse-glossy or glossy-diffuse-glossy reflections especially when they are highly glossy. To improve the efficiency for such light path configurations, we propose a hierarchical Russian roulette technique for vertex connections. Our technique accelerates a huge number of Russian roulette operations according to an approximate scattering lobe at an eye-subpath vertex for many cached light-subpath vertices. Our method dramatically reduces the number of random number generations needed for Russian roulette by introducing a hierarchical rejection algorithm which assigns random numbers in a top-down fashion. To efficiently reject light vertices in each hierarchy, we also introduce an efficient approximation of anisotropic scattering lobes used for the probability of Russian roulette. Our technique is easy to integrate into some existing bidirectional path tracing-based algorithms which cache light-subpath vertices (e.g., probabilistic connections, and vertex connection and merging). In addition, unlike existing many-light methods, our method does not restrict multiple importance sampling strategies thanks to the simplicity of Russian roulette. Although the proposed technique does not support perfectly specular surfaces, it significantly improves the efficiency for caustics reflected on extremely glossy surfaces in an unbiased fashion.",Hierarchical russian roulette for vertex connections,NA:NA,2018

We theoretically analyze the variance of the optimal MIS weights and show the relation to the variance of the balance heuristic. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the new weighting functions and control variates as previously applied to mixture sampling.

However, physics-based rendering techniques that can accurately simulate these devices are still lacking: while existing algorithms are adequate for certain tasks, such as simulating transient cameras, they are very inefficient for simulating time-gated cameras because of the large number of wasted path samples. We take steps towards addressing these deficiencies, by introducing a procedure for efficiently sampling paths with a predetermined length, and incorporating it within rendering frameworks tailored towards simulating time-gated imaging. We use our open-source implementation of the above to empirically demonstrate improved rendering performance in a variety of applications, including simulating proximity sensors, imaging through occlusions, depth-selective cameras, transient imaging in dynamic scenes, and non-line-of-sight imaging.",Ellipsoidal path connections for time-gated rendering,NA:NA:NA,2018
Chen Bar:Marina Alterman:Ioannis Gkioulekas:Anat Levin,"We present a Monte Carlo rendering framework for the physically-accurate simulation of speckle patterns arising from volumetric scattering of coherent waves. These noise-like patterns are characterized by strong statistical properties, such as the so-called memory effect. These properties are at the core of imaging techniques for applications as diverse as tissue imaging, motion tracking, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Our rendering framework can replicate these properties computationally, in a way that is orders of magnitude more efficient than alternatives based on directly solving the wave equations. At the core of our framework is a path-space formulation for the covariance of speckle patterns arising from a scattering volume, which we derive from first principles. We use this formulation to develop two Monte Carlo rendering algorithms, for computing speckle covariance as well as directly speckle fields. While approaches based on wave equation solvers require knowing the microscopic position of wavelength-sized scatterers, our approach takes as input only bulk parameters describing the statistical distribution of these scatterers inside a volume. We validate the accuracy of our framework by comparing against speckle patterns simulated using wave equation solvers, use it to simulate memory effect observations that were previously only possible through lab measurements, and demonstrate its applicability for computational imaging tasks.",A Monte Carlo framework for rendering speckle statistics in scattering media,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Arsène Pérard-Gayot:Richard Membarth:Roland Leißa:Sebastian Hack:Philipp Slusallek,"Monte-Carlo Renderers must generate many color samples to produce a noise-free image, and for each of those, they must evaluate complex mathematical models representing the appearance of the objects in the scene. These models are usually in the form of shaders: Small programs that are executed during rendering in order to compute a value for the current sample. Renderers often compile and optimize shaders just before rendering, taking advantage of the knowledge of the scene. In principle, the entire renderer could benefit from a-priori code generation. For instance, scheduling can take advantage of the knowledge of the scene in order to maximize hardware usage. However, writing such a configurable renderer eventually means writing a compiler that translates a scene description into machine code. In this paper, we present a framework that allows generating entire renderers for CPUs and GPUs without having to write a dedicated compiler: First, we provide a rendering library in a functional/imperative language that elegantly abstracts the individual rendering concepts using higher-order functions. Second, we use partial evaluation to combine and specialize the individual components of a renderer according to a particular scene.

However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs (Figure 1, 8).

Robin Roussel:Marie-Paule Cani:Jean-Claude Léon:Niloy J. Mitra,"Chain reaction contraptions, commonly referred to as Rube Goldberg machines, achieve simple tasks in an intentionally complex fashion via a cascading sequence of events. They are fun, engaging and satisfying to watch. Physically realizing them, however, involves hours or even days of manual trial-and-error effort. The main difficulties lie in predicting failure factors over long chains of events and robustly enforcing an expected causality between parallel chains, especially under perturbations of the layout. We present a computational framework to help design the layout of such contraptions by optimizing their robustness to possible assembly errors. Inspired by the active learning paradigm in machine learning, we propose a generic sampling-based method to progressively approximate the success probability distribution of a given scenario over the design space of possible scene layouts. The success or failure of any given simulation is determined from a user-specified causal graph enforcing a time ordering between expected events. Our method scales to complex causal graphs and high dimensional design spaces by dividing the graph and scene into simpler sub-scenarios. The aggregated success probability distribution is subsequently used to optimize the entire layout. We demonstrate the use of our framework through a range of real world examples of increasing complexity, and report significant improvements over alternative approaches.

Bailey Miller:Iliyan Georgiev:Wojciech Jarosz,"Unbiased rendering of general, heterogeneous participating media currently requires using null-collision approaches for estimating transmittance and generating free-flight distances. A long-standing limitation of these approaches, however, is that the corresponding path pdfs cannot be computed due to the black-box nature of the null-collision rejection sampling process. These techniques therefore cannot be combined with other sampling techniques via multiple importance sampling (MIS), which significantly limits their robustness and generality. Recently, Galtier et al. [2013] showed how to derive these algorithms directly from the radiative transfer equation (RTE). We build off this generalized RTE to derive a path integral formulation of null scattering, which reveals the sampling pdfs and allows us to devise new, express existing, and combine complementary unbiased techniques via MIS. We demonstrate the practicality of our theory by combining, for the first time, several path sampling techniques in spatially and spectrally varying media, generalizing and outperforming the prior state of the art.",A null-scattering path integral formulation of light transport,NA:NA:NA,2018
Jie Guo:Yanjun Chen:Bingyang Hu:Ling-Qi Yan:Yanwen Guo:Yuntao Liu,"Transmission of radiation through spatially-correlated media has demonstrated deviations from the classical exponential law of the corresponding uncorrelated media. In this paper, we propose a general, physically-based method for modeling such correlated media with non-exponential decay of transmittance. We describe spatial correlations by introducing the Fractional Gaussian Field (FGF), a powerful mathematical tool that has proven useful in many areas but remains under-explored in graphics. With the FGF, we study the effects of correlations in a unified manner, by modeling both high-frequency, noise-like fluctuations and k-th order fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with a stochastic continuity property. As a result, we are able to reproduce a wide variety of appearances stemming from different types of spatial correlations. Compared to previous work, our method is the first that addresses both short-range and long-range correlations using physically-based fluctuation models. We show that our method can simulate different extents of randomness in spatially-correlated media, resulting in a smooth transition in a range of appearances from exponential falloff to complete transparency. We further demonstrate how our method can be integrated into an energy-conserving RTE framework with a well-designed importance sampling scheme and validate its ability compared to the classical transport theory and previous work.",Fractional gaussian fields for modeling and rendering of spatially-correlated media,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Xi Deng:Shaojie Jiao:Benedikt Bitterli:Wojciech Jarosz,"We generalize photon planes to photon surfaces: a new family of unbiased volumetric density estimators which we combine using multiple importance sampling. To derive our new estimators, we start with the extended path integral which duplicates the vertex at the end of the camera and photon subpaths and couples them using a blurring kernel. To make our formulation unbiased, however, we use a delta kernel to couple these two end points. Unfortunately, sampling the resulting singular integral using Monte Carlo is impossible since the probability of generating a contributing light path by independently sampling the two subpaths is zero. Our key insight is that we can eliminate the delta kernel and make Monte Carlo estimation practical by integrating any three dimensions analytically, and integrating only the remaining dimensions using Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the practicality of this approach by instantiating a collection of estimators which analytically integrate the distance along the camera ray and two arbitrary sampling dimensions along the photon subpath (e.g., distance, direction, surface area). This generalizes photon planes to curved ""photon surfaces"", including new ""photon cone"", ""photon cylinder"", ""photon sphere"", and multiple new ""photon plane"" estimators. These estimators allow us to handle light paths not supported by photon planes, including single scattering, and surface-to-media transport. More importantly, since our estimators have complementary strengths due to analytically integrating different dimensions of the path integral, we can combine them using multiple importance sampling. This combination mitigates singularities present in individual estimators, substantially reducing variance while remaining fully unbiased. We demonstrate our improved estimators on a number of scenes containing homogeneous media with highly anisotropic phase functions, accelerating both multiple scattering and single scattering compared to prior techniques.","Photon surfaces for robust, unbiased volumetric density estimation",NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Calvin Kuo:Ziheng Liang:Ye Fan:Jean-Sébastien Blouin:Dinesh K. Pai,"Human motion capture using video-based or sensor-based methods gives animators the capability to directly translate complex human motions to create lifelike character animations. Advances in motion capture algorithms have improved their accuracy for estimating human generalized motion coordinates (joint angles and body positions). However, the traditional motion capture pipeline is not well suited to measure short duration, high acceleration impacts, such as running and jumping footstrikes. While high acceleration impacts have minimal influence on generalized coordinates, they play a big role in exciting soft tissue dynamics. Here we present a method for correcting motion capture trajectories using a sparse set of inertial measurement units (IMUs) collecting at high sampling rates to produce more accurate impact accelerations without sacrificing accuracy of the generalized coordinates representing gross motions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by correcting human motion captured experimentally using commercial motion capture systems with high rate IMUs sampling at 400Hz during basketball jump shots and running. With our method, we automatically corrected 185 jumping impacts and 1266 running impacts from 5 subjects. Post correction, we found an average increase of 84.6% and 91.1% in pelvis vertical acceleration and ankle dorsiflexion velocity respectively for basketball jump shots, and an average increase of 110% and 237% in pelvis vertical acceleration and ankle plantarflexion velocity respectively for running. In both activities, pelvis vertical position and ankle angle had small corrections on average below 2.0cm and 0.20rad respectively. Finally, when driving a human rig with soft tissue dynamics using corrected motions, we found a 143.4% and 11.2% increase in soft tissue oscillation amplitudes in basketball jump shots and running respectively. Our methodology can be generalized to correct impact accelerations for other body segments, and provide new tools to create realistic soft tissue animations during dynamic activities for more lifelike characters and better motion reconstruction for biomechanical analyses.",Creating impactful characters: correcting human impact accelerations using high rate IMUs in dynamic activities,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Hao Zhang:Zi-Hao Bo:Jun-Hai Yong:Feng Xu,"Hand-object interaction is challenging to reconstruct but important for many applications like HCI, robotics and so on. Previous works focus on either the hand or the object while we jointly track the hand poses, fuse the 3D object model and reconstruct its rigid and nonrigid motions, and perform all these tasks in real time. To achieve this, we first use a DNN to segment the hand and object in the two input depth streams and predict the current hand pose based on the previous poses by a pre-trained LSTM network. With this information, a unified optimization framework is proposed to jointly track the hand poses and object motions. The optimization integrates the segmented depth maps, the predicted motion, a spatial-temporal varying rigidity regularizer and a real-time contact constraint.

In order to achieve this, we embed a recent parametric hand pose and shape model and a dense correspondence predictor based on a deep neural network into a suitable energy minimization framework. For training the correspondence prediction network, we synthesize a two-hand dataset based on physical simulations that includes both hand pose and shape annotations while at the same time avoiding inter-hand penetrations.

Max Lyon:Marcel Campen:David Bommes:Leif Kobbelt,"The generation of quad meshes based on surface parametrization techniques has proven to be a versatile approach. These techniques quantize an initial seamless parametrization so as to obtain an integer grid map implying a pure quad mesh. State-of-the-art methods following this approach have to assume that the surface to be meshed either has no boundary, or has a boundary which the resulting mesh is supposed to be aligned to. In a variety of applications this is not desirable and non-boundary-aligned meshes or grid-parametrizations are preferred. We thus present a technique to robustly generate integer grid maps which are either boundary-aligned, non-boundary-aligned, or partially boundary-aligned, just as required by different applications. We thereby generalize previous work to this broader setting. This enables the reliable generation of trimmed quad meshes with partial elements along the boundary, preferable in various scenarios, from tiled texturing over design and modeling to fabrication and architecture, due to fewer constraints and hence higher overall mesh quality and other benefits in terms of aesthetics and flexibility.",Parametrization quantization with free boundaries for trimmed quad meshing,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

Kilian Verhetsel:Jeanne Pellerin:Jean-François Remacle,"This paper tackles the challenging problem of constrained hexahedral meshing. An algorithm is introduced to build combinatorial hexahedral meshes whose boundary facets exactly match a given quadrangulation of the topological sphere. This algorithm is the first practical solution to the problem. It is able to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the previously known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained thousands of hexahedra. These challenging quadrangulations include the boundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success of general hexahedral meshing algorithms. The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to building combinatorial hexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical problem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad flips in the boundary and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary. The tree of all sequences of flipping operations is explored, searching for a path that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation for which a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a sequence transforming Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set of pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used. A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is proposed. Combined with an efficient backtracking search, it allows small shellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all even quadrangulations with up to 20 quadrangles. All 54, 943 such quadrangulations were meshed using no more than 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill arbitrary domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n quadrangles can be meshed with no more than 78 n hexahedra.

Marc Alexa,"We introduce the notion of harmonic triangulations: a harmonic triangulation simultaneously minimizes the Dirichlet energy of all piecewise linear functions. By a famous result of Rippa, Delaunay triangulations are the harmonic triangulations of planar point sets. We prove by explicit counterexample that in 3D a harmonic triangulation does not exist in general. However, we show that bistellar flips are harmonic: if they decrease Dirichlet energy for one set of function values, they do so for all. This observation gives rise to the notion of locally harmonic triangulations. We demonstrate that locally harmonic triangulations can be efficiently computed, and efficiently reduce sliver tetrahedra. The notion of harmonic triangulation also gives rise to a scalar measure of the quality of a triangulation, which can be used to prioritize flips and optimize the position of vertices. Tetrahedral meshes generated by optimizing this function generally show better quality than Delaunay-based optimization techniques.",Harmonic triangulations,NA,2018
Nicholas Sharp:Yousuf Soliman:Keenan Crane,"We present a data structure that makes it easy to run a large class of algorithms from computational geometry and scientific computing on extremely poor-quality surface meshes. Rather than changing the geometry, as in traditional remeshing, we consider intrinsic triangulations which connect vertices by straight paths along the exact geometry of the input mesh. Our key insight is that such a triangulation can be encoded implicitly by storing the direction and distance to neighboring vertices. The resulting signpost data structure then allows geometric and topological queries to be made on-demand by tracing paths across the surface. Existing algorithms can be easily translated into the intrinsic setting, since this data structure supports the same basic operations as an ordinary triangle mesh (vertex insertions, edge splits, etc.). The output of intrinsic algorithms can then be stored on an ordinary mesh for subsequent use; unlike previous data structures, we use a constant amount of memory and do not need to explicitly construct an overlay mesh unless it is specifically requested. Working in the intrinsic setting incurs little computational overhead, yet we can run algorithms on extremely degenerate inputs, including all manifold meshes from the Thingi10k data set. To evaluate our data structure we implement several fundamental geometric algorithms including intrinsic versions of Delaunay refinement and optimal Delaunay triangulation, approximation of Steiner trees, adaptive mesh refinement for PDEs, and computation of Poisson equations, geodesic distance, and flip-free tangent vector fields.",Navigating intrinsic triangulations,NA:NA:NA,2018
Balázs Csébfalvi,"In volume-rendering applications, it is a de facto standard to reconstruct the underlying continuous function by using trilinear interpolation, and to estimate the gradients for the shading computations by calculating central differences on the fly. In a GPU implementation, this requires seven trilinear texture samples: one for the function reconstruction, and six for the gradient estimation. In this paper, for the first time, we show that the six additional samples can be used not just for gradient estimation, but for significantly improving the quality of the function reconstruction as well. As the additional arithmetic operations can be performed in the shadow of the texture fetches, we can achieve this quality improvement for free without reducing the rendering performance at all. Therefore, our method can completely replace the standard trilinear interpolation in the practice of GPU-accelerated volume rendering.",Beyond trilinear interpolation: higher quality for free,NA,2018
Thibault Tricard:Semyon Efremov:Cédric Zanni:Fabrice Neyret:Jonàs Martínez:Sylvain Lefebvre,"Procedural pattern synthesis is a fundamental tool of Computer Graphics, ubiquitous in games and special effects. By calling a single procedure in every pixel - or voxel - large quantities of details are generated at low cost, enhancing textures, producing complex structures within and along surfaces. Such procedures are typically implemented as pixel shaders. We propose a novel procedural pattern synthesis technique that exhibits desirable properties for modeling highly contrasted patterns, that are especially well suited to produce surface and microstructure details. In particular, our synthesizer affords for a precise control over the profile, orientation and distribution of the produced stochastic patterns, while allowing to grade all these parameters spatially. Our technique defines a stochastic smooth phase field - a phasor noise - that is then fed into a periodic function (e.g. a sine wave), producing an oscillating field with prescribed main frequencies and preserved contrast oscillations. In addition, the profile of each oscillation is directly controllable (e.g. sine wave, sawtooth, rectangular or any 1D profile). Our technique builds upon a reformulation of Gabor noise in terms of a phasor field that affords for a clear separation between local intensity and phase. Applications range from texturing to modeling surface displacements, as well as multi-material microstructures in the context of additive manufacturing.",Procedural phasor noise,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

First, it is hard for GANs to precisely reproduce an input image. Second, after manipulation, the newly synthesized pixels often do not fit the original image. In this paper, we address these issues by adapting the image prior learned by GANs to image statistics of an individual image. Our method can accurately reconstruct the input image and synthesize new content, consistent with the appearance of the input image. We demonstrate our interactive system on several semantic image editing tasks, including synthesizing new objects consistent with background, removing unwanted objects, and changing the appearance of an object. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons against several existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",Semantic photo manipulation with a generative image prior,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Jordan Yaniv:Yael Newman:Ariel Shamir,"Facial Landmark detection in natural images is a very active research domain. Impressive progress has been made in recent years, with the rise of neural-network based methods and large-scale datasets. However, it is still a challenging and largely unexplored problem in the artistic portraits domain. Compared to natural face images, artistic portraits are much more diverse. They contain a much wider style variation in both geometry and texture and are more complex to analyze. Moreover, datasets that are necessary to train neural networks are unavailable. We propose a method for artistic augmentation of natural face images that enables training deep neural networks for landmark detection in artistic portraits. We utilize conventional facial landmarks datasets, and transform their content from natural images into ""artistic face"" images. In addition, we use a feature-based landmark correction step, to reduce the dependency between the different facial features, which is necessary due to position and shape variations of facial landmarks in artworks. To evaluate our landmark detection framework, we created an ""Artistic-Faces"" dataset, containing 160 artworks of various art genres, artists and styles, with a large variation in both geometry and texture. Using our method, we can detect facial features in artistic portraits and analyze their geometric style. This allows the definition of signatures for artistic styles of artworks and artists, that encode both the geometry and the texture style. It also allows us to present a geometric-aware style transfer method for portraits.",The face of art: landmark detection and geometric style in portraits,NA:NA:NA,2018
YiChang Shih:Wei-Sheng Lai:Chia-Kai Liang,"Photographers take wide-angle shots to enjoy expanding views, group portraits that never miss anyone, or composite subjects with spectacular scenery background. In spite of the rapid proliferation of wide-angle cameras on mobile phones, a wider field-of-view (FOV) introduces a stronger perspective distortion. Most notably, faces are stretched, squished, and skewed, to look vastly different from real-life. Correcting such distortions requires professional editing skills, as trivial manipulations can introduce other kinds of distortions. This paper introduces a new algorithm to undistort faces without affecting other parts of the photo. Given a portrait as an input, we formulate an optimization problem to create a content-aware warping mesh which locally adapts to the stereographic projection on facial regions, and seamlessly evolves to the perspective projection over the background. Our new energy function performs effectively and reliably for a large group of subjects in the photo. The proposed algorithm is fully automatic and operates at an interactive rate on the mobile platform. We demonstrate promising results on a wide range of FOVs from 70° to 120°.",Distortion-free wide-angle portraits on camera phones,NA:NA:NA,2018
Katja Wolff:Olga Sorkine-Hornung,"Despite recent developments towards on-demand, individualized garment design and fabrication, the majority of processes in the fashion industry are still inefficient and heavily dependent on manual work. A significant amount of recent research in this area has been focused on supporting designers to digitally create sewing patterns and shapes, but there is little work on textured fabrics. Aligning textile patterns like stripes or plaid along garment seams requires an experienced tailor and is thus reserved only for expensive, high-end garments. We present an interactive algorithm for automatically aligning repetitive textile patterns along seams for a given garment, allowing a user to make design choices at each step of our pipeline. Our approach is based on the 17 wallpaper groups and the symmetries they exhibit. We exploit these symmetries to optimize the alignment of the sewing pattern with the textured fabric for each of its pieces, determining where to cut the fabric. We optionally alter the sewing pattern slightly for a perfect fit along seams, without visibly changing the 3D shape of the garment. The pieces can then be cut automatically by a CNC or laser cutter. Our approach fits within the pipeline of digital garment design, eliminating the difficult, manual step of aligning and cutting the garment pieces by hand.",Wallpaper pattern alignment along garment seams,NA:NA,2018
Vidya Narayanan:Kui Wu:Cem Yuksel:James McCann,"Industrial knitting machines are commonly used to manufacture complicated shapes from yarns; however, designing patterns for these machines requires extensive training. We present the first general visual programming interface for creating 3D objects with complex surface finishes on industrial knitting machines. At the core of our interface is a new, augmented, version of the stitch mesh data structure. The augmented stitch mesh stores low-level knitting operations per-face and encodes the dependencies between faces using directed edge labels. Our system can generate knittable augmented stitch meshes from 3D models, allows users to edit these meshes in a way that preserves their knittability, and can schedule the execution order and location of each face for production on a knitting machine. Our system is general, in that its knittability-preserving editing operations are sufficient to transform between any two machine-knittable stitch patterns with the same orientation on the same surface. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our pipeline by using it to create and knit objects featuring a wide range of patterns and textures, including intarsia and Fair Isle colorwork; knit and purl textures; cable patterns; and laces.",Visual knitting machine programming,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Hao Liu:Xiao-Teng Zhang:Xiao-Ming Fu:Zhi-Chao Dong:Ligang Liu,"Some artists peel citrus fruits into a variety of elegant 2D shapes, depicting animals, plants, and cartoons. It is a creative art form, called Citrus Peeling Art. This art form follows the conservation principle, i.e., each shape must be created using one entire peel. Central to this art is finding optimal cut lines so that the citruses can be cut and unfolded into the desired shapes. However, it is extremely difficult for users to imagine and generate cuts for their desired shapes. To this end, we present a computational method for citrus peeling art designs. Our key insight is that instead of solving the difficult cut generation problem, we map a designed input shape onto a citrus in an attempt to cover the entire citrus and use the mapped boundary to generate the cut paths. Sometimes, a mapped shape is unable to completely cover a citrus. Consequently, we have developed five customized ways of interaction that are used to rectify the input shape so that it is suitable for citrus peeling art. The mapping process and user interactions are iteratively conducted to satisfy a user's design intentions. A large number of experiments, including a formative user study, demonstrate the capability and practicability of our method for peeling art design and construction.",Computational peeling art design,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Stephen Lombardi:Tomas Simon:Jason Saragih:Gabriel Schwartz:Andreas Lehrmann:Yaser Sheikh,"Modeling and rendering of dynamic scenes is challenging, as natural scenes often contain complex phenomena such as thin structures, evolving topology, translucency, scattering, occlusion, and biological motion. Mesh-based reconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches (e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions, which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case in point.",Neural volumes: learning dynamic renderable volumes from images,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Justus Thies:Michael Zollhöfer:Matthias Nießner,"The modern computer graphics pipeline can synthesize images at remarkable visual quality; however, it requires well-defined, high-quality 3D content as input. In this work, we explore the use of imperfect 3D content, for instance, obtained from photo-metric reconstructions with noisy and incomplete surface geometry, while still aiming to produce photo-realistic (re-)renderings. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Deferred Neural Rendering, a new paradigm for image synthesis that combines the traditional graphics pipeline with learnable components. Specifically, we propose Neural Textures, which are learned feature maps that are trained as part of the scene capture process. Similar to traditional textures, neural textures are stored as maps on top of 3D mesh proxies; however, the high-dimensional feature maps contain significantly more information, which can be interpreted by our new deferred neural rendering pipeline. Both neural textures and deferred neural renderer are trained end-to-end, enabling us to synthesize photo-realistic images even when the original 3D content was imperfect. In contrast to traditional, black-box 2D generative neural networks, our 3D representation gives us explicit control over the generated output, and allows for a wide range of application domains. For instance, we can synthesize temporally-consistent video re-renderings of recorded 3D scenes as our representation is inherently embedded in 3D space. This way, neural textures can be utilized to coherently re-render or manipulate existing video content in both static and dynamic environments at real-time rates. We show the effectiveness of our approach in several experiments on novel view synthesis, scene editing, and facial reenactment, and compare to state-of-the-art approaches that leverage the standard graphics pipeline as well as conventional generative neural networks.",Deferred neural rendering: image synthesis using neural textures,NA:NA:NA,2018

Harley:Stephen Lombardi:Michal Perdoch:Alexander Hypes:Dawei Wang:Hernan Badino:Yaser Sheikh,"A key promise of Virtual Reality (VR) is the possibility of remote social interaction that is more immersive than any prior telecommunication media. However, existing social VR experiences are mediated by inauthentic digital representations of the user (i.e., stylized avatars). These stylized representations have limited the adoption of social VR applications in precisely those cases where immersion is most necessary (e.g., professional interactions and intimate conversations). In this work, we present a bidirectional system that can animate avatar heads of both users' full likeness using consumer-friendly headset mounted cameras (HMC). There are two main challenges in doing this: unaccommodating camera views and the image-to-avatar domain gap. We address both challenges by leveraging constraints imposed by multiview geometry to establish precise image-to-avatar correspondence, which are then used to learn an end-to-end model for real-time tracking. We present designs for a training HMC, aimed at data-collection and model building, and a tracking HMC for use during interactions in VR. Correspondence between the avatar and the HMC-acquired images are automatically found through self-supervised multiview image translation, which does not require manual annotation or one-to-one correspondence between domains.

We propose a novel method to edit talking-head video based on its transcript to produce a realistic output video in which the dialogue of the speaker has been modified, while maintaining a seamless audio-visual flow (i.e. no jump cuts). Our method automatically annotates an input talking-head video with phonemes, visemes, 3D face pose and geometry, reflectance, expression and scene illumination per frame. To edit a video, the user has to only edit the transcript, and an optimization strategy then chooses segments of the input corpus as base material. The annotated parameters corresponding to the selected segments are seamlessly stitched together and used to produce an intermediate video representation in which the lower half of the face is rendered with a parametric face model. Finally, a recurrent video generation network transforms this representation to a photorealistic video that matches the edited transcript.

Theodore Kim:Fernando De Goes:Hayley Iben,"We present an analysis of anisotropic hyperelasticity, specifically transverse isotropy, that obtains closed-form expressions for the eigendecompositions of many common energies. We then use these to build fast and concise Newton implementations. We leverage our analysis in two separate applications. First, we show that existing anisotropic energies are not inversion-safe, and contain spurious stable states under large deformation. We then propose a new anisotropic strain invariant that enables the formulation of a novel, robust, and inversion-safe energy. The new energy fits completely within our analysis, so closed-form expressions are obtained for its eigensystem as well. Secondly, we use our analysis to rehabilitate badly-conditioned finite elements. Using this method, we can robustly simulate large deformations even when a mesh contains degenerate, zero-volume elements. We accomplish this by swapping the badly-behaved isotropic direction with a well-behaved anisotropic term. We validate our approach on a variety of examples.",Anisotropic elasticity for inversion-safety and element rehabilitation,NA:NA:NA,2018

Critical to these advances, we require efficient time step solvers that reliably solve all implicit time integration problems for elastica. While available time step solvers succeed admirably in some regimes, they become impractically slow, inaccurate, unstable, or even divergent in others --- as we show here. Towards addressing these needs we present the Decomposed Optimization Time Integrator (DOT), a new domain-decomposed optimization method for solving the per time step, nonlinear problems of implicit numerical time integration. DOT is especially suitable for large time step simulations of deformable bodies with nonlinear materials and high-speed dynamics. It is efficient, automated, and robust at large, fixed-size time steps, thus ensuring stable, continued progress of high-quality simulation output. Across a broad range of extreme and mild deformation dynamics, using frame-rate size time steps with widely varying object shapes and mesh resolutions, we show that DOT always converges to user-set tolerances, generally well-exceeding and always close to the best wall-clock times across all previous nonlinear time step solvers, irrespective of the deformation applied.",Decomposed optimization time integrator for large-step elastodynamics,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

In this work, we propose an interpolation framework which is based on a Lie group representation of the affine transformation. The Lie group representation decomposes the given transformation into simpler and meaningful components, on which computational tools like the exponential and logarithm maps are available in closed form. Interpolation exists for all affine transformations while preserving a few characteristics of the original transformation.

Yifeng Jiang:Tom Van Wouwe:Friedl De Groote:C. Karen Liu,"Using joint actuators to drive the skeletal movements is a common practice in character animation, but the resultant torque patterns are often unnatural or infeasible for real humans to achieve. On the other hand, physiologically-based models explicitly simulate muscles and tendons and thus produce more human-like movements and torque patterns. This paper introduces a technique to transform an optimal control problem formulated in the muscle-actuation space to an equivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, such that the solutions to both problems have the same optimal value. By solving the equivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, we can generate human-like motions comparable to those generated by musculotendon models, while retaining the benefit of simple modeling and fast computation offered by joint-actuation models. Our method transforms constant bounds on muscle activations to nonlinear, state-dependent torque limits in the joint-actuation space. In addition, the metabolic energy function on muscle activations is transformed to a nonlinear function of joint torques, joint configuration and joint velocity. Our technique can also benefit policy optimization using deep reinforcement learning approach, by providing a more anatomically realistic action space for the agent to explore during the learning process. We take the advantage of the physiologically-based simulator, OpenSim, to provide training data for learning the torque limits and the metabolic energy function.

The problem of online full-body soccer motion synthesis is challenging and has not been fully solved yet. In this paper, we present a novel motion control system that produces physically-correct full-body soccer motions: dribbling forward, dribbling to the side, and shooting, in response to an online user motion prescription specified by a motion type, a running speed, and a turning angle. This system performs two tightly-coupled tasks: data-driven motion prediction and physics-based motion synthesis. Given example motion data, the former synthesizes a reference motion in accordance with an online user input and further refines the motion to make the character kick the ball at a right time and place. Provided with the reference motion, the latter then adopts a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate a physically-correct soccer motion, by solving an optimal control problem that is formulated based on dynamics for a full-body character and the moving ball together with their interactions. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed system that synthesizes convincing full-body soccer motions in various scenarios such as adjusting the desired running speed of the character, changing the velocity and the mass of the ball, and maintaining balance against external forces.",Physics-based full-body soccer motion control for dribbling and shooting,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

One such application, of particular importance in computer animation, is the retargeting of motion from one performer to another. While humans move in three dimensions, the vast majority of human motions are captured using video, requiring 2D-to-3D pose and camera recovery, before existing retargeting approaches may be applied. In this paper, we present a new method for retargeting video-captured motion between different human performers, without the need to explicitly reconstruct 3D poses and/or camera parameters. In order to achieve our goal, we learn to extract, directly from a video, a high-level latent motion representation, which is invariant to the skeleton geometry and the camera view. Our key idea is to train a deep neural network to decompose temporal sequences of 2D poses into three components: motion, skeleton, and camera view-angle. Having extracted such a representation, we are able to re-combine motion with novel skeletons and camera views, and decode a retargeted temporal sequence, which we compare to a ground truth from a synthetic dataset. We demonstrate that our framework can be used to robustly extract human motion from videos, bypassing 3D reconstruction, and outperforming existing retargeting methods, when applied to videos in-the-wild. It also enables additional applications, such as performance cloning, video-driven cartoons, and motion retrieval.",Learning character-agnostic motion for motion retargeting in 2D,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

While relighting from sparse images has received significant attention, there has been relatively less progress on view synthesis from a sparse set of ""photometric"" images---images captured under controlled conditions, lit by a single directional source; we use a spherical gantry to position the camera on a sphere surrounding the object. In this paper, we synthesize novel viewpoints across a wide range of viewing directions (covering a 60° cone) from a sparse set of just six viewing directions. While our approach relates to previous view synthesis and image-based rendering techniques, those methods are usually restricted to much smaller baselines, and are captured under environment illumination. At our baselines, input images have few correspondences and large occlusions; however we benefit from structured photometric images. Our method is based on a deep convolutional network trained to directly synthesize new views from the six input views. This network combines 3D convolutions on a plane sweep volume with a novel per-view per-depth plane attention map prediction network to effectively aggregate multi-view appearance. We train our network with a large-scale synthetic dataset of 1000 scenes with complex geometry and material properties. In practice, it is able to synthesize novel viewpoints for captured real data and reproduces complex appearance effects like occlusions, view-dependent specularities and hard shadows.

In particular, we introduce a geometry-aware neural network that utilizes multiple geometry cues (normal maps, specular direction, etc.) and source and target shadow masks computed from a noisy proxy geometry obtained by multi-view stereo. Our model is a three-stage pipeline: two subnetworks refine the source and target shadow masks, and a third performs the final relighting. Furthermore, we introduce a novel representation for the shadow masks, which we call RGB shadow images. They reproject the colors from all views into the shadowed pixels and enable our network to cope with inacuraccies in the proxy and the non-locality of the shadow casting interactions. Acquiring large-scale multi-view relighting datasets for real scenes is challenging, so we train our network on photorealistic synthetic data. At train time, we also compute a noisy stereo-based geometric proxy, this time from the synthetic renderings. This allows us to bridge the gap between the real and synthetic domains.

Chrystiano Araújo:Daniela Cabiddu:Marco Attene:Marco Livesu:Nicholas Vining:Alla Sheffer,"Users frequently seek to fabricate objects whose outer surfaces consist of regions with different surface attributes, such as color or material. Manufacturing such objects in a single piece is often challenging or even impossible. The alternative is to partition them into single-attribute volumetric parts that can be fabricated separately and then assembled to form the target object. Facilitating this approach requires partitioning the input model into parts that conform to the surface segmentation and that can be moved apart with no collisions. We propose Surface2Volume, a partition algorithm capable of producing such assemblable parts, each of which is affiliated with a single attribute, the outer surface of whose assembly conforms to the input surface geometry and segmentation. In computing the partition we strictly enforce conformity with surface segmentation and assemblability, and optimize for ease of fabrication by minimizing part count, promoting part simplicity, and simplifying assembly sequencing. We note that computing the desired partition requires solving for three types of variables: per-part assembly trajectories, partition topology, i.e. the connectivity of the interface surfaces separating the different parts, and the geometry, or location, of these interfaces. We efficiently produce the desired partitions by addressing one type of variables at a time: first computing the assembly trajectories, then determining interface topology, and finally computing interface locations that allow parts assemblability. We algorithmically identify inputs that necessitate sequential assembly, and partition these inputs gradually by computing and disassembling a subset of assemblable parts at a time. We demonstrate our method's robustness and versatility by employing it to partition a range of models with complex surface segmentations into assemblable parts.

As a result, produced parts exhibit a so-called staircase effect, which results from sampling slanted surfaces with parallel planes. Using thinner slices reduces this effect, but it always remains visible where layers almost align with the input surfaces. In this research we exploit the ability of some additive manufacturing processes to deposit material slightly out of plane to dramatically reduce these artifacts. We focus in particular on the widespread Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology, since most printers in this category can deposit along slightly curved paths, under deposition slope and thickness constraints. Our algorithm curves the layers, making them either follow the natural slope of the input surface or on the contrary, make them intersect the surfaces at a steeper angle thereby improving the sampling quality. Rather than directly computing curved layers, our algorithm optimizes for a deformation of the model which is then sliced with a standard planar approach. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to encode all fabrication constraints, including the guarantee of generating collision-free toolpaths, in a convex optimization that can be solved using a QP solver. We produce a variety of models and compare print quality between curved deposition and planar slicing.",CurviSlicer: slightly curved slicing for 3-axis printers,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

J. Panetta:M. Konaković-Luković:F. Isvoranu:E. Bouleau:M. Pauly,"We present X-shells, a new class of deployable structures formed by an ensemble of elastically deforming beams coupled through rotational joints. An X-shell can be assembled conveniently in a flat configuration from standard elastic beam elements and then deployed through force actuation into the desired 3D target state. During deployment, the coupling imposed by the joints will force the beams to twist and buckle out of plane to maintain a state of static equilibrium. This complex interaction of discrete joints and continuously deforming beams allows interesting 3D forms to emerge. Simulating X-shells is challenging, however, due to unstable equilibria at the onset of beam buckling. We propose an optimization-based simulation framework building on a discrete rod model that robustly handles such difficult scenarios by analyzing and appropriately modifying the elastic energy Hessian. This real-time simulation method forms the basis of a computational design tool for X-shells that enables interactive design space exploration by varying and optimizing design parameters to achieve a specific design intent. We jointly optimize the assembly state and the deployed configuration to ensure the geometric and structural integrity of the deployable X-shell. Once a design is finalized, we also optimize for a sparse distribution of actuation forces to efficiently deploy it from its flat assembly state to its 3D target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design approach with a number of design studies that highlight the richness of the X-shell design space, enabling new forms not possible with existing approaches. We validate our computational model with several physical prototypes that show excellent agreement with the optimized digital models.",X-Shells: a new class of deployable beam structures,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Siyan Dong:Kai Xu:Qiang Zhou:Andrea Tagliasacchi:Shiqing Xin:Matthias Nießner:Baoquan Chen,"We present an autonomous scanning approach which allows multiple robots to perform collaborative scanning for dense 3D reconstruction of unknown indoor scenes. Our method plans scanning paths for several robots, allowing them to efficiently coordinate with each other such that the collective scanning coverage and reconstruction quality is maximized while the overall scanning effort is minimized. To this end, we define the problem as a dynamic task assignment and introduce a novel formulation based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT). Given the currently scanned scene, a set of task views are extracted to cover scene regions which are either unknown or uncertain. These task views are assigned to the robots based on the OMT optimization. We then compute for each robot a smooth path over its assigned tasks by solving an approximate traveling salesman problem. In order to showcase our algorithm, we implement a multi-robot auto-scanning system. Since our method is computationally efficient, we can easily run it in real time on commodity hardware, and combine it with online RGB-D reconstruction approaches. In our results, we show several real-world examples of large indoor environments; in addition, we build a benchmark with a series of carefully designed metrics for quantitatively evaluating multi-robot autoscanning. Overall, we are able to demonstrate high-quality scanning results with respect to reconstruction quality and scanning efficiency, which significantly outperforms existing multi-robot exploration systems.",Multi-robot collaborative dense scene reconstruction,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

Alternatively, researchers have proposed computationally-expensive methods that directly minimize the distance function between surfaces. We introduce a new symmetrized objective function that achieves the simplicity and computational efficiency of point-to-plane optimization, while yielding improved convergence speed and a wider convergence basin. In addition, we present a linearization of the objective that is exact in the case of exact correspondences.

Recent progress has also allowed the use of CT for analyzing deforming objects and dynamic phenomena, although the deformations have been constrained to be either slow or periodic motions. In this work we improve the tomographic reconstruction of time-varying geometries undergoing faster, non-periodic deformations. Our method uses a warp-and-project approach that allows us to introduce an essentially continuous time axis where consistency of the reconstructed shape with the projection images is enforced for the specific time and deformation state at which the image was captured. The method uses an efficient, time-adaptive solver that yields both the moving geometry as well as the deformation field.

Etienne Corman:Keenan Crane,"A basic challenge in field-guided hexahedral meshing is to find a spatially-varying frame that is adapted to the domain geometry and is continuous up to symmetries of the cube. We introduce a fundamentally new representation of such 3D cross fields based on Cartan's method of moving frames. Our key observation is that cross fields and ordinary frame fields are locally characterized by identical conditions on their Darboux derivative. Hence, by using derivatives as the principal representation (and only later recovering the field itself), one avoids the need to explicitly account for symmetry during optimization. At the discrete level, derivatives are encoded by skew-symmetric matrices associated with the edges of a tetrahedral mesh; these matrices encode arbitrarily large rotations along each edge, and can robustly capture singular behavior even on coarse meshes. We apply this representation to compute 3D cross fields that are as smooth as possible everywhere but on a prescribed network of singular curves---since these fields are adapted to curve tangents, they can be directly used as input for field-guided mesh generation algorithms. Optimization amounts to an easy nonlinear least squares problem that behaves like a convex program in the sense that it always appears to produce the same result, independent of initialization. We study the numerical behavior of this procedure, and perform some preliminary experiments with mesh generation.",Symmetric moving frames,NA:NA,2018

Our model is designed with topology in mind, sliding singular points along the surface rather than having them appear and disappear, and it caters to all surface topologies, including boundary and generator loops.",Optimal transport-based polar interpolation of directional fields,NA:NA,2018
Nicolas Bonneel:David Coeurjolly,"Optimal transport research has surged in the last decade with wide applications in computer graphics. In most cases, however, it has focused on the special case of the so-called ""balanced"" optimal transport problem, that is, the problem of optimally matching positive measures of equal total mass. While this approach is suitable for handling probability distributions as their total mass is always equal to one, it precludes other applications manipulating disparate measures. Our paper proposes a fast approach to the optimal transport of constant distributions supported on point sets of different cardinality via one-dimensional slices. This leads to one-dimensional partial assignment problems akin to alignment problems encountered in genomics or text comparison. Contrary to one-dimensional balanced optimal transport that leads to a trivial linear-time algorithm, such partial optimal transport, even in 1-d, has not seen any closed-form solution nor very efficient algorithms to date. We provide the first efficient 1-d partial optimal transport solver. Along with a quasilinear time problem decomposition algorithm, it solves 1-d assignment problems consisting of up to millions of Dirac distributions within fractions of a second in parallel. We handle higher dimensional problems via a slicing approach, and further extend the popular iterative closest point algorithm using optimal transport - an algorithm we call Fast Iterative Sliced Transport. We illustrate our method on computer graphics applications such a color transfer and point cloud registration.",SPOT: sliced partial optimal transport,NA:NA,2018
Rana Hanocka:Amir Hertz:Noa Fish:Raja Giryes:Shachar Fleishman:Daniel Cohen-Or,"Polygonal meshes provide an efficient representation for 3D shapes. They explicitly captureboth shape surface and topology, and leverage non-uniformity to represent large flat regions as well as sharp, intricate features. This non-uniformity and irregularity, however, inhibits mesh analysis efforts using neural networks that combine convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we utilize the unique properties of the mesh for a direct analysis of 3D shapes using MeshCNN, a convolutional neural network designed specifically for triangular meshes. Analogous to classic CNNs, MeshCNN combines specialized convolution and pooling layers that operate on the mesh edges, by leveraging their intrinsic geodesic connections. Convolutions are applied on edges and the four edges of their incident triangles, and pooling is applied via an edge collapse operation that retains surface topology, thereby, generating new mesh connectivity for the subsequent convolutions. MeshCNN learns which edges to collapse, thus forming a task-driven process where the network exposes and expands the important features while discarding the redundant ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MeshCNN on various learning tasks applied to 3D meshes.",MeshCNN: a network with an edge,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Zhijie Wu:Xiang Wang:Di Lin:Dani Lischinski:Daniel Cohen-Or:Hui Huang,"We present SAGNet, a structure-aware generative model for 3D shapes. Given a set of segmented objects of a certain class, the geometry of their parts and the pairwise relationships between them (the structure) are jointly learned and embedded in a latent space by an autoencoder. The encoder intertwines the geometry and structure features into a single latent code, while the decoder disentangles the features and reconstructs the geometry and structure of the 3D model. Our autoencoder consists of two branches, one for the structure and one for the geometry. The key idea is that during the analysis, the two branches exchange information between them, thereby learning the dependencies between structure and geometry and encoding two augmented features, which are then fused into a single latent code. This explicit intertwining of information enables separately controlling the geometry and the structure of the generated models. We evaluate the performance of our method and conduct an ablation study. We explicitly show that encoding of shapes accounts for both similarities in structure and geometry.

Aron Monszpart:Paul Guerrero:Duygu Ceylan:Ersin Yumer:Niloy J. Mitra,"Next generation smart and augmented reality systems demand a computational understanding of monocular footage that captures humans in physical spaces to reveal plausible object arrangements and human-object interactions. Despite recent advances, both in scene layout and human motion analysis, the above setting remains challenging to analyze due to regular occlusions that occur between objects and human motions. We observe that the interaction between object arrangements and human actions is often strongly correlated, and hence can be used to help recover from these occlusions. We present iMapper, a data-driven method to identify such human-object interactions and utilize them to infer layouts of occluded objects. Starting from a monocular video with detected 2D human joint positions that are potentially noisy and occluded, we first introduce the notion of interaction-saliency as space-time snapshots where informative human-object interactions happen. Then, we propose a global optimization to retrieve and fit interactions from a database to the detected salient interactions in order to best explain the input video. We extensively evaluate the approach, both quantitatively against manually annotated ground truth and through a user study, and demonstrate that iMapper produces plausible scene layouts for scenes with medium to heavy occlusion.

In this contribution, we employ smooth magnets to simulate ferrofluids in contrast to previous methods based on the finite element method or point magnets. We solve the magnetization using the analytical solution of the smooth magnets' field, and derive the bounded magnetic force formulas addressing particle penetration. We integrate the magnetic field and force evaluations into the fast multipole method allowing for efficient large-scale simulations of ferrofluids. The presented simulations are well reproducible since our approach can be easily incorporated into a framework implementing a Fast Multipole Method and a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics fluid solver with surface tension.

Ryan Goldade:Yipeng Wang:Mridul Aanjaneya:Christopher Batty,"While pressure forces are often the bottleneck in (near-)inviscid fluid simulations, viscosity can impose orders of magnitude greater computational costs at lower Reynolds numbers. We propose an implicit octree finite difference discretization that significantly accelerates the solution of the free surface viscosity equations using adaptive staggered grids, while supporting viscous buckling and rotation effects, variable viscosity, and interaction with scripted moving solids. In experimental comparisons against regular grids, our method reduced the number of active velocity degrees of freedom by as much as a factor of 7.7 and reduced linear system solution times by factors between 3.8 and 9.4. We achieve this by developing a novel adaptive variational finite difference methodology for octrees and applying it to the optimization form of the viscosity problem. This yields a linear system that is symmetric positive definite by construction, unlike naive finite difference/volume methods, and much sparser than a hypothetical finite element alternative. Grid refinement studies show spatial convergence at first order in L∞ and second order in L1, while the significantly smaller size of the octree linear systems allows for the solution of viscous forces at higher effective resolutions than with regular grids. We demonstrate the practical benefits of our adaptive scheme by replacing the regular grid viscosity step of a commercial liquid simulator (Houdini) to yield large speed-ups, and by incorporating it into an existing inviscid octree simulator to add support for viscous flows. Animations of viscous liquids pouring, bending, stirring, buckling, and melting illustrate that our octree method offers significant computational gains and excellent visual consistency with its regular grid counterpart.",An adaptive variational finite difference framework for efficient symmetric octree viscosity,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

We propose a nonlinear blending model that can capture intriguing flowing behaviors that can differ from that of the individual constituents (Fig. 1). We used a laboratory device, rheometer, to measure the flowing properties of various fluid-like foods, and found that an elastic Herschel-Bulkley model has nice agreements with the measured data even for the mixtures of these foods. We then constructed a blending model such that it qualitatively agrees with the measurements and is closed in the parameter space of the elastic Herschel-Bulkley model. We provide validations through comparisons between the measured and estimated properties using our model, and comparisons between simulated examples and captured footages.

Enrique Rosales:Jafet Rodriguez:ALLA SHEFFER,"Popular Virtual Reality (VR) tools allow users to draw varying-width, ribbonlike 3D brush strokes by moving a hand-held controller in 3D space. Artists frequently use dense collections of such strokes to draw virtual 3D shapes. We propose SurfaceBrush, a surfacing method that converts such VR drawings into user-intended manifold free-form 3D surfaces, providing a novel approach for modeling 3D shapes. The inputs to our method consist of dense collections of artist-drawn stroke ribbons described by the positions and normals of their central polylines, and ribbon widths. These inputs are highly distinct from those handled by existing surfacing frameworks and exhibit different sparsity and error patterns, necessitating a novel surfacing approach. We surface the input stroke drawings by identifying and leveraging local coherence between nearby artist strokes. In particular, we observe that strokes intended to be adjacent on the artist imagined surface often have similar tangent directions along their respective polylines. We leverage this local stroke direction consistency by casting the computation of the user-intended manifold surface as a constrained matching problem on stroke polyline vertices and edges. We first detect and smoothly connect adjacent similarly-directed sequences of stroke edges producing one or more manifold partial surfaces. We then complete the surfacing process by identifying and connecting adjacent similarly directed edges along the borders of these partial surfaces. We confirm the usability of the SurfaceBrush interface and the validity of our drawing analysis via an observational study. We validate our stroke surfacing algorithm by demonstrating an array of manifold surfaces computed by our framework starting from a range of inputs of varying complexity, and by comparing our outputs to reconstructions computed using alternative means.",SurfaceBrush: from virtual reality drawings to manifold surfaces,NA:NA:NA,2018
Sebastian Friston:Tobias Ritschel:Anthony Steed,"We suggest a rasterization pipeline tailored towards the needs of HMDs, where latency and field-of-view requirements pose new challenges beyond those of traditional desktop displays. Instead of image warping for low latency, or using multiple passes for foveation, we show how both can be produced directly in a single perceptual rasterization pass. We do this with per-fragment ray-casting. This is enabled by derivations of tight space-time-fovea pixel bounds, introducing just enough flexibility for the requisite geometric tests, but retaining most of the simplicity and efficiency of the traditional rasterizaton pipeline. To produce foveated images, we rasterize to an image with spatially varying pixel density. To compensate for latency, we extend the image formation model to directly produce ""rolling"" images where the time at each pixel depends on its display location. Our approach overcomes limitations of warping with respect to disocclusions, object motion and view-dependent shading, as well as geometric aliasing artifacts in other foveated rendering techniques.

A promising solution to overcome these problems is foveated rendering, which exploits gaze information to reduce rendering quality for the peripheral vision where the requirements of the human visual system are significantly lower. Most of the current solutions model the sensitivity as a function of eccentricity, neglecting the fact that it also is strongly influenced by the displayed content. In this work, we propose a new luminance-contrast-aware foveated rendering technique which demonstrates that the computational savings of foveated rendering can be significantly improved if local luminance contrast of the image is analyzed. To this end, we first study the resolution requirements at different eccentricities as a function of luminance patterns. We later use this information to derive a low-cost predictor of the foveated rendering parameters. Its main feature is the ability to predict the parameters using only a low-resolution version of the current frame, even though the prediction holds for high-resolution rendering. This property is essential for the estimation of required quality before the full-resolution image is rendered. We demonstrate that our predictor can efficiently drive the foveated rendering technique and analyze its benefits in a series of user experiments.",Luminance-contrast-aware foveated rendering,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

The same optics relay an image of the eye to an infrared camera used for gaze tracking, which in turn drives the foveal display location and peripheral nodal point. Our display supports accommodation cues by varying the focal depth of the microdisplay in the foveal region, and by rendering simulated defocus on the ""always in focus"" scanning laser projector used for peripheral display.

We propose a physics-based model to understand the nonlinear mechanical response of widgets. This understanding enables us to design tactile force profiles of these widgets so that the resulting accelerometer signals become easy to recognize. We then develop a lightweight signal processing algorithm that analyzes the accelerometer signals and recognizes how the user interacts with the widgets in real time.

Loïc Ciccone:Cengiz Öztireli:Robert W. Sumner,"Character animation tools are based on a keyframing metaphor where artists pose characters at selected keyframes and the software automatically interpolates the frames inbetween. Although the quality of the interpolation is critical for achieving a fluid and engaging animation, the tools available to adjust the result of the automatic inbetweening are rudimentary and typically require manual editing of spline parameters. As a result, artists spend a tremendous amount of time posing and setting more keyframes. In this pose-centric workflow, animators use combinations of forward and inverse kinematics. While forward kinematics leads to intuitive interpolations, it does not naturally support positional constraints such as fixed contact points. Inverse kinematics can be used to fix certain points in space at keyframes, but can lead to inferior interpolations, is slow to compute, and does not allow for positional contraints at non-keyframe frames. In this paper, we address these problems by formulating the control of interpolations with positional constraints over time as a space-time optimization problem in the tangent space of the animation curves driving the controls. Our method has the key properties that it (1) allows the manipulation of positions and orientations over time, extending inverse kinematics, (2) does not add new keyframes that might conflict with an artist's preferred keyframe style, and (3) works in the space of artist editable animation curves and hence integrates seamlessly with current pipelines.

Simon Zimmermann:Roi Poranne:James M. Bern:Stelian Coros,"We present a computational framework for robotic animation of real-world string puppets. Also known as marionettes, these articulated figures are typically brought to life by human puppeteers. The puppeteer manipulates rigid handles that are attached to the puppet from above via strings. The motions of the marionette are therefore governed largely by gravity, the pull forces exerted by the strings, and the internal forces arising from mechanical articulation constraints. This seemingly simple setup conceals a very challenging and nuanced control problem, as marionettes are, in fact, complex coupled pendulum systems. Despite this, in the hands of a master puppeteer, marionette animation can be nothing short of mesmerizing. Our goal is to enable autonomous robots to animate marionettes with a level of skill that approaches that of human puppeteers. To this end, we devise a predictive control model that accounts for the dynamics of the marionette and kinematics of the robot puppeteer. The input to our system consists of a string puppet design and a target motion, and our trajectory planning algorithm computes robot control actions that lead to the marionette moving as desired.

Ying Wang:Nicholas J. Weidner:Margaret A. Baxter:Yura Hwang:Danny M. Kaufman:Shinjiro Sueda,"It is well known that the dynamics of articulated rigid bodies can be solved in O(n) time using a recursive method, where n is the number of joints. However, when elasticity is added between the bodies (e.g., damped springs), with linearly implicit integration, the stiffness matrix in the equations of motion breaks the tree topology of the system, making the recursive O(n) method inapplicable. In such cases, the only alternative has been to form and solve the system matrix, which takes O(n3) time. We propose a new approach that is capable of solving the linearly implicit equations of motion in near linear time. Our method, which we call RedMax, is built using a combined reduced/maximal coordinate formulation. This hybrid model enables direct flexibility to apply arbitrary combinations of constraints and contact modeling in both reduced and maximal coordinates, as well as mixtures of implicit and explicit forces in either coordinate representation. We highlight RedMax's flexibility with seamless integration of deformable objects with two-way coupling, at a standard additional cost. We further highlight its flexibility by constructing an efficient internal (joint) and external (environment) frictional contact solver that can leverage bilateral joint constraints for rapid evaluation of frictional articulated dynamics.",RedMax: efficient & flexible approach for articulated dynamics,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

In response, we introduce a novel approach for spectral coarsening. We show that it is possible to significantly reduce the sampling density of an operator derived from a 3D shape without affecting the low-frequency eigenvectors. By marrying techniques developed within the algebraic multigrid and the functional maps literatures, we successfully coarsen a variety of isotropic and anisotropic operators while maintaining sparsity and positive semi-definiteness.

Prior work has focused on computing efficient maps between pairs of shapes, and has shown a quantifiable benefit of joint map synchronization, where a collection of shapes are used to improve (denoise) the pairwise maps for consistency and correctness. However, these existing map synchronization techniques place very strong assumptions on the input shapes collection such as all the input shapes fall into the same category and/or the majority of the input pairwise maps are correct. In this paper, we present a multiple map synchronization approach that takes a heterogeneous shape collection as input and simultaneously outputs consistent dense pairwise shape maps.

While users can enjoy natural-looking NFoV videos using this approach, they need to constantly make manual adjustment of the viewing direction not to miss interesting events in the video. In this paper, we propose an interactive and automatic navigation system for comfortable 360° video playback. Our system finds a virtual camera path that shows the most salient areas through the video, generates a NFoV video based on the path, and plays it in an online manner. A user can interactively change the viewing direction while watching a video, and the system instantly updates the path reflecting the intention of the user. To enable online processing, we design our system consisting of an offline pre-processing step, and an online 360° video navigation step. The pre-processing step computes optical flow and saliency scores for an input video. Based on these, the online video navigation step computes an optimal camera path reflecting user interaction, and plays a NFoV video in an online manner.

The process of fabric formwork is akin to molding and casting but having a soft boundary. Deformation of the fabric container is governed by force equilibrium between the pressure forces from liquid fill and tension in the stretched fabric. The final result of fabrication depends on the shapes of the flat panels, the fabrication orientation and the placement of external supports. Our computational framework generates optimized flat panels and fabrication orientation with reference to a target shape, and determines effective locations for external supports. We demonstrate the function of this design tool on a variety of models with different shapes and topology. Physical fabrication is also demonstrated to validate our approach.",Computational design of fabric formwork,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Thomas Alderighi:Luigi Malomo:Daniela Giorgi:Bernd Bickel:Paolo Cignoni:Nico Pietroni,"We propose a novel technique for the automatic design of molds to cast highly complex shapes. The technique generates composite, two-piece molds. Each mold piece is made up of a hard plastic shell and a flexible silicone part. Thanks to the thin, soft, and smartly shaped silicone part, which is kept in place by a hard plastic shell, we can cast objects of unprecedented complexity. An innovative algorithm based on a volumetric analysis defines the layout of the internal cuts in the silicone mold part. Our approach can robustly handle thin protruding features and intertwined topologies that have caused previous methods to fail. We compare our results with state of the art techniques, and we demonstrate the casting of shapes with extremely complex geometry.",Volume-aware design of composite molds,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Denis Sumin:Tobias Rittig:Vahid Babaei:Thomas Nindel:Alexander Wilkie:Piotr Didyk:Bernd Bickel:Jaroslav Křivánek:Karol Myszkowski:Tim Weyrich,"Commercially available full-color 3D printing allows for detailed control of material deposition in a volume, but an exact reproduction of a target surface appearance is hampered by the strong subsurface scattering that causes nontrivial volumetric cross-talk at the print surface. Previous work showed how an iterative optimization scheme based on accumulating absorptive materials at the surface can be used to find a volumetric distribution of print materials that closely approximates a given target appearance. In this work, we first revisit the assumption that pushing the absorptive materials to the surface results in minimal volumetric cross-talk. We design a full-fledged optimization on a small domain for this task and confirm this previously reported heuristic. Then, we extend the above approach that is critically limited to color reproduction on planar surfaces, to arbitrary 3D shapes. Our method enables high-fidelity color texture reproduction on 3D prints by effectively compensating for internal light scattering within arbitrarily shaped objects. In addition, we propose a content-aware gamut mapping that significantly improves color reproduction for the pathological case of thin geometric features. Using a wide range of sample objects with complex textures and geometries, we demonstrate color reproduction whose fidelity is superior to state-of-the-art drivers for color 3D printers.",Geometry-aware scattering compensation for 3D printing,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Henrique Teles Maia:Dingzeyu Li:Yuan Yang:Changxi Zheng,"With the advance of personal and customized fabrication techniques, the capability to embed information in physical objects becomes evermore crucial. We present LayerCode, a tagging scheme that embeds a carefully designed barcode pattern in 3D printed objects as a deliberate byproduct of the 3D printing process. The LayerCode concept is inspired by the structural resemblance between the parallel black and white bars of the standard barcode and the universal layer-by-layer approach of 3D printing. We introduce an encoding algorithm that enables the 3D printing layers to carry information without altering the object geometry. We also introduce a decoding algorithm that reads the LayerCode tag of a physical object by just taking a photo. The physical deployment of LayerCode tags is realized on various types of 3D printers, including Fused Deposition Modeling printers as well as Stereolithography based printers. Each offers its own advantages and tradeoffs. We show that LayerCode tags can work on complex, nontrivial shapes, on which all previous tagging mechanisms may fail. To evaluate LayerCode thoroughly, we further stress test it with a large dataset of complex shapes using virtual rendering. Among 4,835 tested shapes, we successfully encode and decode on more than 99% of the shapes.",LayerCode: optical barcodes for 3D printed shapes,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Binh Huy Le:J P Lewis,"A significant fraction of the world's population have experienced virtual characters through games and movies, and the possibility of online VR social experiences may greatly extend this audience. At present, the skin deformation for interactive and real-time characters is typically computed using geometric skinning methods. These methods are efficient and simple to implement, but obtaining quality results requires considerable manual ""rigging"" effort involving trial-and-error weight painting, the addition of virtual helper bones, etc. The recently introduced Delta Mush algorithm largely solves this rig authoring problem, but its iterative computational approach has prevented direct adoption in real-time engines. This paper introduces Direct Delta Mush, a new algorithm that simultaneously improves on the efficiency and control of Delta Mush while generalizing previous algorithms. Specifically, we derive a direct rather than iterative algorithm that has the same ballpark computational form as some previous geometric weight blending algorithms. Straightforward variants of the algorithm are then proposed to further optimize computational and storage cost with insignificant quality losses. These variants are equivalent to special cases of several previous skinning algorithms. Our algorithm simultaneously satisfies the goals of reasonable efficiency, quality, and ease of authoring. Further, its explicit decomposition of rotational and translational effects allows independent control over bending versus twisting deformation, as well as a skin sliding effect.",Direct delta mush skinning and variants,NA:NA,2018
Lijuan Liu:Youyi Zheng:Di Tang:Yi Yuan:Changjie Fan:Kun Zhou,"We present a deep-learning-based method to automatically compute skin weights for skeleton-based deformation of production characters. Given a character mesh and its associated skeleton hierarchy in rest pose, our method constructs a graph for the mesh, each node of which encodes the mesh-skeleton attributes of a vertex. An end-to-end deep graph convolution network is then introduced to learn the mesh-skeleton binding patterns from a set of character models with skin weights painted by artists. The network can be used to predict the skin weight map for a new character model, which describes how the skeleton hierarchy influences the mesh vertices during deformation. Our method is designed to work for non-manifold meshes with multiple disjoint or intersected components, which are common in game production and require complex skeleton hierarchies for animation control. We tested our method on the datasets of two commercial games. Experiments show that the predicted skin weight maps can be readily applied to characters in the production pipeline to generate high-quality deformations.",NeuroSkinning: automatic skin binding for production characters with deep graph networks,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Bohan Wang:George Matcuk:Jernej Barbič,"We demonstrate how to acquire complete human hand bone anatomy (meshes) in multiple poses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such acquisition was previously difficult because MRI scans must be long for high-precision results (over 10 minutes) and because humans cannot hold the hand perfectly still in non-trivial and badly supported poses. We invent a manufacturing process whereby we use lifecasting materials commonly employed in film special effects industry to generate hand molds, personalized to the subject, and to each pose. These molds are both ergonomic and encasing, and they stabilize the hand during scanning. We also demonstrate how to efficiently segment the MRI scans into individual bone meshes in all poses, and how to correspond each bone's mesh to same mesh connectivity across all poses. Next, we interpolate and extrapolate the MRI-acquired bone meshes to the entire range of motion of the hand, producing an accurate data-driven animation-ready rig for bone meshes. We also demonstrate how to acquire not just bone geometry (using MRI) in each pose, but also a matching highly accurate surface geometry (using optical scanners) in each pose, modeling skin pores and wrinkles. We also give a soft tissue Finite Element Method simulation ""rig"", consisting of novel tet meshing for stability at the joints, spatially varying geometric and material detail, and quality constraints to the acquired skeleton kinematic rig. Given an animation sequence of hand joint angles, our FEM soft tissue rig produces quality hand surface shapes in arbitrary poses in the hand range of motion. Our results qualitatively reproduce important features seen in the photographs of the subject's hand, such as similar overall organic shape and fold formation.",Hand modeling and simulation using stabilized magnetic resonance imaging,NA:NA:NA,2018
David B. Lindell:Gordon Wetzstein:Matthew O'Toole,"Imaging objects outside a camera's direct line of sight has important applications in robotic vision, remote sensing, and many other domains. Time-of-flight-based non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging systems have recently demonstrated impressive results, but several challenges remain. Image formation and inversion models have been slow or limited by the types of hidden surfaces that can be imaged. Moreover, non-planar sampling surfaces and non-confocal scanning methods have not been supported by efficient NLOS algorithms. With this work, we introduce a wave-based image formation model for the problem of NLOS imaging. Inspired by inverse methods used in seismology, we adapt a frequency-domain method, f-k migration, for solving the inverse NLOS problem. Unlike existing NLOS algorithms, f-k migration is both fast and memory efficient, it is robust to specular and other complex reflectance properties, and we show how it can be used with non-confocally scanned measurements as well as for non-planar sampling surfaces. f-k migration is more robust to measurement noise than alternative methods, generally produces better quality reconstructions, and is easy to implement. We experimentally validate our algorithms with a new NLOS imaging system that records room-sized scenes outdoors under indirect sunlight, and scans persons wearing retroreflective clothing at interactive rates.",Wave-based non-line-of-sight imaging using fast f-k migration,NA:NA:NA,2018

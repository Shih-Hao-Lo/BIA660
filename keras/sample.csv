Behnoush Abdollahi:Olfa Nasraoui,"Explanations have been shown to increase the user's trust in recommendations in addition to providing other benefits such as scrutability, which is the ability to verify the validity of recommendations. Most explanation methods are designed for classical neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) or rule-based methods. For the state of the art Matrix Factorization (MF) recommender systems, recent explanation methods, require an additional data source, such as item content data, in addition to rating data. In this paper, we address the case where no such additional data is available and propose a new Explainable Matrix Factorization (EMF) technique that computes an accurate top-$n$ recommendation list of items that are explainable. We also introduce new explanation quality metrics, that we call Mean Explainability Precision (MEP) and Mean Explainability Recall (MER).",Explainable Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering,NA:NA,2016
Medha Atre,"Evaluating SPARQL queries with the DISTINCT clause may become memory intensive due to the requirement of additional auxiliary data structures, like hash-maps, to discard the duplicates. DISTINCT queries make up to 16% of all the queries (e.g., DBPedia), and thus are non-negligible. In this poster we propose a novel method for such queries, by just manipulating the compressed bit-vector indexes called BitMats, for acyclic basic graph pattern (BGP) queries.",For the DISTINCT Clause of SPARQL Queries,NA,2016
Xiaomei Bai:Jun Zhang:Hai Cui:Zhaolong Ning:Feng Xia,"Evaluating the impact of an article is a significant topic and has attracted extensive attention. Citation-based assessment methods currently face a limitation, i.e. the anomalous citations patterns still remain poorly understand. To remedy this drawback, we propose a Positive and Negative Conflict of Interest (COI)-based Rank algorithm, named PNCOIRank, to acquire positive COI, negative COI, positive suspected COI and negative suspected COI relationships. We investigate the citation relationships by the following scholarly factors: citing times, the interval of citing time, collaboration times, the interval of collaboration time, and team of citing authors with the purpose of weakening the COI relationships in citation network. A weighted PageRank is finally constructed and employed, with HITS algorithm to assess the impact of articles. Through experiments on American Physical Society (APS) dataset, we show that PNCOIRank significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of recommendation intensity.",PNCOIRank: Evaluating the Impact of Scholarly Articles with Positive and Negative Citations,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Rajesh Basak:Niloy Ganguly:Shamik Sural:Soumya K. Ghosh,"Online social networks (OSNs) are often flooded with scathing remarks against individuals or businesses on their perceived wrongdoing. This paper studies three such events to get insight into various aspects of shaming done through twitter. An important contribution of our work is categorization of shaming tweets, which helps in understanding the dynamics of spread of online shaming events. It also facilitates automated segregation of shaming tweets from non-shaming ones.",Look Before You Shame: A Study on Shaming Activities on Twitter,NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Amna Basharat:I. Budak Arpinar:Khaled Rasheed,"In this paper, we illustrate how we leverage crowdsourcing to create workflows for knowledge engineering in specialized and knowledge intensive domains. We undertake the special case of the Arabic script of the Qur'an, a widely studied manuscript, and attempt to employ crowdsourcing methods for its thematic annotation at the sub-verse level, for which, there is no standardized knowledge model available to date. We demonstrate that our proposed method presents feasibility to achieve reliable annotations in an efficient and scalable manner. The proposed methodology and framework is meant to be generalizable to other knowledge intensive and specialized domains.",Leveraging Crowdsourcing for the Thematic Annotation of the Qur'an,NA:NA:NA,2016
Murat Ali Bayir:Ismail Hakki Toroslu,"This paper introduces a new method for the session construction problem, which is the first main step of the web usage mining process. The proposed method is capable of extracting all possible maximal navigation sequences of web users. Through experiments, it is shown that when our new technique is used, it outperforms previous approaches in web usage mining applications such as next-page prediction.",Finding All Maximal Paths In Web User Sessions,NA:NA,2016
Martin Becker:Hauke Mewes:Andreas Hotho:Dimitar Dimitrov:Florian Lemmerich:Markus Strohmaier,"HypTrails is a bayesian approach for comparing different hypotheses about human trails on the web. While a standard implementation exists, it exposes performance issues when working with large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a distributed implementation of HypTrails based on Apache Spark taking advantage of several structural properties inherent to HypTrails. The performance improves substantially. Our implementation is publicly available.",SparkTrails: A MapReduce Implementation of HypTrails for Comparing Hypotheses About Human Trails,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Atef Chaudhury:Myunghwan Kim:Mitul Tiwari,"In both the online and offline world, networks that people form within certain communities are critical for their engagement and growth in those communities. In this work, we analyze the growth of ego-networks on LinkedIn for new employees of companies, and study how the pattern of network formation in the new company affects one's growth and engagement in that company. We observe that the initial state of ego-network growth in a newly joined company shows strong correlations with the future status in the company -- such as network size, network diversity, and retention. We also present some key patterns that demonstrate the importance of the first few connections in the new company as well as how they lead to the phenomena we observed.","Importance of First Steps in a Community for Growth, Diversity, and Engagement",NA:NA:NA,2016
Xu Chen:Pengfei Wang:Zheng Qin:Yongfeng Zhang,"Bayesian Personal Ranking(BPR) method is a well-known model due to its high performance in the task of item recommendation. However, this method fail to distinguish user preference among the non-interacted items. In this paper, to enhance traditional BPR's performance, we introduce and analyse a hybrid method, namely Hybrid Local Bayesian Personal Ranking method(HLBPR for short). Our main idea is to construct additional item preference pairs among the products which haven't been purchased, and then utilize the extened pairs to optimize the ranking object. Experiments on two real-world transaction datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",HLBPR: A Hybrid Local Bayesian Personal Ranking Method,NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Hélène de Ribaupierre:Francesco Osborne:Enrico Motta,"The natural language processing (NLP) community has developed a variety of methods for extracting and disambiguating information from research publications. However, they usually focus only on standard research entities such as authors, affiliations, venues, references and keywords. We propose a novel approach, which combines NLP and semantic technologies for generating from the text of research publications an OWL ontology describing software technologies used or introduced by researchers, such as applications, systems, frameworks, programming languages, and formats. The method was tested on a sample of 300 publications in the Semantic Web field, yielding promising results.",Combining NLP And Semantics For Mining Software Technologies From Research Publications,NA:NA:NA,2016

Dimitar Dimitrov:Philipp Singer:Florian Lemmerich:Markus Strohmaier,"In this work, we study the visual position of links and their clicks on Wikipedia, particularly where links are visually located, at which screen positions users click on links, and which areas on the screen exhibit more or less clicks per links. For that purpose, we introduce a novel dataset containing the on-screen coordinate position for all links between pages in the English Wikipedia and additionally resort to navigation logs of Wikipedia users. Using this data, we can observe a preference of certain link and click locations on Wikipedia including first evidence of positional click bias. For example, our results suggest that users have a tendency to prefer to click on the left side of the screen which exceeds what one would expect from the presence of links on pages. We believe that presented data and research can be useful for optimizing the process of link creation and link consumption on Wikipedia and other Web platforms.",Visual Positions of Links and Clicks on Wikipedia,NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Hui Du:Xueke Xu:Xueqi Cheng:Dayong Wu:Yue Liu:Zhihua Yu,"Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely applied to sentiment analysis of short texts. Naturally, word embedding techniques are used to learn continuous word representations for constructing sentence matrix as input to CNN. As for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, we argue that it is problematic to learn a single representation for a word while ignoring sentiment information and the discussed aspects. In this poster, we propose a novel word embedding model to learn sentimental word embedding given specific aspects by modeling both sentiment and syntactic context under the specific aspects. We apply our method as input to CNN for sentiment analysis in multiple domains. Experiments show that the CNN based on the proposed model can consistently achieve superior performance compared to CNN based on traditional word embedding method.",Aspect-Specific Sentimental Word Embedding for Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Nemanja Duric:Mihajlo Grbovic:Vladan Radosavljevic:Jaikit Savla:Varun Bhagwan:Doug Sharp,"Tourism industry has grown tremendously in the previous several decades. Despite its global impact, there still remain a number of open questions related to better understanding of tourists and their habits. In this work we analyze the largest data set of travel receipts considered thus far, and focus on exploring and modeling booking behavior of online customers. We extract useful, actionable insights into the booking behavior, and tackle the task of predicting the booking time. The presented results can be directly used to improve booking experience of customers and optimize targeting campaigns of travel operators.",Travel the World: Analyzing and Predicting Booking Behavior using E-mail Travel Receipts,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2016
Jinhua Gao:Huawei Shen:Shenghua Liu:Xueqi Cheng,"Modeling and predicting retweeting dynamics in social media has important implications to an array of applications. Existing models either fail to model the triggering effect of retweeting dynamics, e.g., the model based on reinforced Poisson process, or are hard to be trained using only the retweeting dynamics of individual tweet, e.g., the model based on self-exciting Hawkes process. In this paper, motivated by the observation that each retweeting dynamics is generally dominated by a handful of key nodes that separately trigger a high number of retweets, we propose a mixture process to model and predict retweeting dynamics, with each subprocess capturing the retweeting dynamics initiated by a key node. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model.",Modeling and Predicting Retweeting Dynamics via a Mixture Process,NA:NA:NA:NA,2016

This paper aims at analysing a large volume of GPS data in spatio-temporal context, clustering trajectories using geographic and semantic location information and identifying different categories of people. It tries to exploit the fact that human moves with an intent. The proposed framework yields encouraging results using a large scale GPS dataset of Microsoft GeoLife.",THUMP: Semantic Analysis on Trajectory Traces to Explore Human Movement Pattern,NA:NA,2016
Zafar Gilani:Liang Wang:Jon Crowcroft:Mario Almeida:Reza Farahbakhsh,"The WWW has seen a massive growth in variety and usage of OSNs. The rising population of users on Twitter and its open nature has made it an ideal platform for various kinds of opportunistic pursuits, such as news and emergency communication, business promotion, political campaigning, spamming and spreading malicious content. Most of these opportunistic pursuits are exploited through automated programs, known as bots.

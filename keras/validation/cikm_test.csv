Reiss:Vijay Bommireddipalli,"A recent trend observed in traditionally challenging fields such as computer vision and natural language processing has been the significant performance gains shown by deep learning (DL). In many different research fields, DL models have been evolving rapidly and become ubiquitous. Despite researchers' excitement, unfortunately, most software developers are not DL experts and oftentimes have a difficult time following the booming DL research outputs. As a result, it usually takes a significant amount of time for the latest superior DL models to prevail in industry. This issue is further exacerbated by the common use of sundry incompatible DL programming frameworks, such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, Theano, etc. To address this issue, we propose a system, called Model Asset Exchange (MAX), that avails developers of easy access to state-of-the-art DL models. Regardless of the underlying DL programming frameworks, it provides an open source Python library (called the MAX framework) that wraps DL models and unifies programming interfaces with our standardized RESTful APIs. These RESTful APIs enable developers to exploit the wrapped DL models for inference tasks without the need to fully understand different DL programming frameworks. Using MAX, we have wrapped and open-sourced more than 30 state-of-the-art DL models from various research fields, including computer vision, natural language processing and signal processing, etc. In the end, we selectively demonstrate two web applications that are built on top of MAX, as well as the process of adding a DL model to MAX.",Model Asset eXchange: Path to Ubiquitous Deep Learning Deployment,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Shay Gershtein:Tova Milo:Slava Novgorodov,"Many e-commerce platforms serve as an intermediary between companies/manufacturers and consumers, receiving a commission per purchase. To increase revenue, such sites tend to offer a wide variety of items. However, in many situations a smaller subset of the items should be selected and offered for sale, e.g., when opening an express branch or expanding to a new region, or when maintenance costs become prohibitive and redundant items should be disposed of. In all these cases selecting a reduced inventory which covers most consumer needs is an important goal. In this demo we introduce ReducE-Comm - a highly parallelizable and scalable system that given a large set of items, a bound on the number of items that can be supported and information about consumer preferences/items relationships, allows to select a subset of the items which maximizes the likelihood of a purchase. Our system is interactive and facilitates real-time analysis, by providing detailed per-item impact statistics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReducE-Comm on real-world data and scenarios taken from a large e-commerce system, by interacting with the CIKM'19 audience who act as analysts aiming to intelligently reduce the inventory.",ReducE-Comm: Effective Inventory Reduction System for E-Commerce,NA:NA:NA,2018
Limeng Cui:Kai Shu:Suhang Wang:Dongwon Lee:Huan Liu,"Despite recent advancements in computationally detecting fake news, we argue that a critical missing piece be the explainability of such detection--i.e., why a particular piece of news is detected as fake--and propose to exploit rich information in users' comments on social media to infer the authenticity of news. In this demo paper, we present our system for an explainable fake news detection called dEFEND, which can detect the authenticity of a piece of news while identifying user comments that can explain why the news is fake or real. Our solution develops a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network to exploit both news contents and user comments to jointly capture explainable top-k check-worthy sentences and user comments for fake news detection. The system is publicly accessible.",dEFEND: A System for Explainable Fake News Detection,NA:NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Rong Duan:Yanghua Xiao,"Data driven Knowledge Graph is rapidly adapted by different societies. Many open domain and specific domain knowledge graphs have been constructed, and many industries have benefited from knowledge graph. Currently, enterprise related knowledge graph is classified as specific domain, but the applications span from solving a narrow specific problem to Enterprise Knowledge Management system. With the digital transform of traditional industry, Enterprise knowledge becomes more and more complicated, it involves knowledge from common domain, multiple specific domains, and corporate-specific in general. This tutorial provides an overview of current Enterprise Knowledge Graph(EKG). It distinguishes the EKG from specific domain according to the knowledge it covers, and provides the examples to illustrate the difference between EKG and specific domain KG. The tutorial further summarizes EKG into three types: Specific Business Task Enterprise KG, Specific Business Unit Enterprise KG and Cross Business Unit Enterprise KG, and illustrates the characteristics, steps, challenges, and future research in constructing and consuming of each of these three types of EKG .",Enterprise Knowledge Graph From Specific Business Task to Enterprise Knowledge Management,NA:NA,2018
Abdullah Mueen:Nikan Chavoshi:Amanda Minnich,"Social bots have been around for over a decade since 2008. Social bots are capable of swaying political opinion, spreading false information, and recruiting for terrorist organizations. Social bots use various sophisticated techniques by adopting emotions, sympathy following, synchronous deletions, and profile molting. There are several approaches proposed in the literature for detection, exploration, and measuring social bots. We provide a comprehensive overview of the existing work from data mining and machine learning perspective, discuss relative strengths and weaknesses of various methods, make recommendations for researchers and practitioners, and propose novel directions for future research in taming the social bots. The tutorial also discusses pitfalls in collecting and sharing data on social bots.","Taming Social Bots: Detection, Exploration and Measurement",NA:NA:NA,2018
Sairam Gurajada:Lucian Popa:Kun Qian:Prithviraj Sen,"This tutorial is intended for researchers and practitioners working in the data integration area and, in particular, entity resolution (ER), which is a sub-area focused on linking entities across heterogeneous datasets. We outline the ideal requirements of modern ER systems: (1) capture domain knowledge via (minimal) human interaction, (2) provide as much automation as possible via machine learning techniques, and (3) achieve high explainability. We describe recent research trends towards bringing such ideal ER systems closer to reality. We begin with an overview of human-in-the-loop methods that are based on techniques such as crowdsourcing and active learning. We then dive into recent trends that involve deep learning techniques such as representation learning to automate feature engineering, and combinations of transfer and active learning to reduce the amount of user labels required. We also discuss how explainable AI relates to ER, and outline some of the recent advances towards explainable ER.",Learning-Based Methods with Human-in-the-Loop for Entity Resolution,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018
Xiang Wang:Xiangnan He:Tat-Seng Chua,"Recommendation methods construct predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a user-item interaction. Previous models largely follow a general supervised learning paradigm --- treating each interaction as a separate data instance and performing prediction based on the ''information isolated island''. Such methods, however, overlook the relations among data instances, which may result in suboptimal performance especially for sparse scenarios. Moreover, the models built on a separate data instance only can hardly exhibit the reasons behind a recommendation, making the recommendation process opaque to understand. In this tutorial, we revisit the recommendation problem from the perspective of graph learning. Common data sources for recommendation can be organized into graphs, such as user-item interactions (bipartite graphs), social networks, item knowledge graphs (heterogeneous graphs), among others. Such a graph-based organization connects the isolated data instances, bringing benefits to exploiting high-order connectivities that encode meaningful patterns for collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, social influence modeling and knowledge-aware reasoning. Together with the recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs), graph-based models have exhibited the potential to be the technologies for next-generation recommendation systems. This tutorial provides a review on graph-based learning methods for recommendation, with special focus on recent developments of GNNs and knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation. By introducing this emerging and promising topic in this tutorial, we expect the audience to get deep understanding and accurate insight on the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies.",Learning and Reasoning on Graph for Recommendation,NA:NA:NA,2018
Chuan Shi:Philip S. Yu,"Recently, there is a surge of research on employing Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) to model complex interaction system, where networks compose of different types of nodes or links, since HIN contains richer structure and semantic information. Many researches develop structural analysis approaches by leveraging the rich semantic meaning of structural types of objects and links in the networks. Furthermore, recent advancement on deep learning and network embedding poses new opportunities and challenges to mine HIN, and heterogeneous network embedding, even heterogeneous graph neural network, is becoming a hot topic. In this tutorial, we will give a survey on recent developments of heterogeneous information network analysis, especially on newly emerging heterogeneous network embedding.

Jiaheng Lu:Chunbin Lin:Jin Wang:Chen Li,"String data is ubiquitous and string similarity search and join are critical to the applications of information retrieval, data integration, data cleaning, and also big data analytics. To support these operations, many techniques in the database and machine learning areas have been proposed independently. More precisely, in the database research area, there are techniques based on the filtering-and-verification framework that can not only achieve a high performance, but also provide guaranteed quality of results for given similarity functions. In the machine learning research area, string similarity processing is modeled as a problem of identifying similar text records; Specifically, the deep learning approaches use embedding techniques that map text to a low-dimensional continuous vector space. In this tutorial, we review a number of studies of string similarity search and join in these two research areas. We divide the studies in each area into different categories. For each category, we provide a comprehensive review of the relevant works, and present the details of these solutions. We conclude this tutorial by pinpointing promising directions for future work to combine techniques in these two areas.",Synergy of Database Techniques and Machine Learning Models for String Similarity Search and Join,NA:NA:NA:NA,2018

In this tutorial we will look under the hood of self-driving cars and of other applications of computer vision and review state-of-the-art tech pipelines for object detection such as two-stage approaches (e.g., Faster R-CNN) or single-stage approaches (e.g., YOLO/SSD). This is accomplished via a series of Jupyter Notebooks that use Python, OpenCV, Keras, and Tensorflow. No prior knowledge of computer vision is assumed (although it will be help!). To this end we begin this tutorial with a review of computer vision and traditional approaches to object detection such as Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG).",Realtime Object Detection via Deep Learning-based Pipelines,NA:NA,2018
Muthusamy Chelliah:Yong Zheng:Sudeshna Sarkar,"Recommender systems are able to produce a list of recommended items tailored to user preferences, while the end user is the only stakeholder in these traditional system. However, there could be multiple stakeholders in several applications domains (e.g., e-commerce, movies, music). Recommendations are necessary to be produced by balancing the needs of different stakeholders. First session of this tutorial introduces multi-stakeholder recommender systems (MSRS) with several case studies, and discusses the corresponding methods and challenges in MSRS. Reviews in an e-commerce platform may be mined to address cold-start problem and to generate explanations. Our earlier tutorial covered aspect-based sentiment analysis of products and topic models/distributed representations that bridge vocabulary gap between user reviews and product descriptions. Focus in the second session of this tutorial instead is on recent neural methods for review text mining - covering hands-on code for its use to enhance product recommendation. Each section will introduce topics from various mechanism (e.g., attention) and task (e.g., review ranking) perspectives, present cutting-edge research and a walk-through of programs executed on Jupyter notebook using real-world data sets.",Recommendation for Multi-stakeholders and through Neural Review Mining,NA:NA:NA,2018
Michalis Vazirgiannis:Giannis Nikolentzos:Giannis Siglidis,"Graphs are becoming a dominant structure in current information management with many domains involved, including social networks, chemistry, biology, etc. Many real-world problems require applying machine learning tasks to graph-structured data. Graph kernels have emerged as a promising approach for dealing with these tasks. A graph kernel is a symmetric, positive semidefinite function on the set of graphs. These functions extend the applicability of kernel methods to graphs. Graph kernels have attracted a lot of attention during the last 20 years. The considerable research activity that occurred in the field resulted in the development of dozens of kernels, each focusing on specific structural properties of graphs. The goal of this tutorial is to offer a comprehensive presentation of a wide range of graph kernels, and to describe their key applications. The tutorial will also offer to the participants hands-on experience in applying graph kernels to classification problems.",Machine Learning on Graphs with Kernels,NA:NA:NA,2018

Most of these approaches rely on the collaborative paradigm (often exploiting machine learning techniques) and do not take into account the huge amount of knowledge, both structured and non-structured ones, describing the domain of interest of the recommendation engine. Although very effective in in predicting relevant items, collaborative approaches miss some very interesting features that go beyond the accuracy of results and move into the direction of providing novel and diverse results as well as generating an explanation for the recommended items or support interactive and conversational recommendation processes.",2nd Workshop on Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems - KaRS,NA:NA,2018

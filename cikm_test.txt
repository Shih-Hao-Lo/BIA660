Zhen Jia:Abdalghani Abujabal:Rishiraj Saha Roy:Jannik Strötgen:Gerhard Weikum	Question answering over knowledge bases (KB-QA) poses challenges in handling complex questions that need to be decomposed into sub-questions. An important case, addressed here, is that of temporal questions, where cues for temporal relations need to be discovered and handled. We present TEQUILA, an enabler method for temporal QA that can run on top of any KB-QA engine. TEQUILA has four stages. It detects if a question has temporal intent. It decomposes and rewrites the question into non-temporal sub-questions and temporal constraints. Answers to sub-questions are then retrieved from the underlying KB-QA engine. Finally, TEQUILA uses constraint reasoning on temporal intervals to compute final answers to the full question. Comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines show the viability of our method.

Haoti Zhong:Anna Squicciarini:David Miller	In an effort to support users' decision making process in regards to shared and co-managed online images, in this paper we present a novel model to early detect images which may be subject to possible conflicting access control decisions. We present a group-based stochastic model able to identify potential privacy conflicts among multiple stakeholders of an image. We discuss experiments on a dataset of over 3000 online images, and compare our results with several baselines. Our approach outperforms all baselines, even the strong ones based on a Convolutional Neural Network architecture.	Toward Automated Multiparty Privacy Conflict Detection	NA:NA:NA	2018
Prayag Tiwari:Massimo Melucci	Machine Learning models learn the relationship between input and output by examples and then apply the learned models to relate unseen input. Although ML has successfully been used in almost every field, there is always room for improvement. To this end, researchers have recently been trying to implement Quantum Mechanics(QM) in ML, since it is believed that quantum-inspired ML can enhance learning rate and effectiveness. In this paper, we address a specific task of ML and present a binary classification model inspired by the quantum detection framework. We compared the model to the state of the art. Our experimental results suggest that the use of the quantum detection framework in binary classification can improve effectiveness for a number of topics of the RCV-1 test collection and that it may still provide ways to improve effectiveness for the other topics.

Liangyue Li:Hanghang Tong:Huan Liu	Networked prediction has attracted lots of research attention in recent years. Compared with the traditional learning setting, networked prediction is even harder to understand due to its coupled, \em multi-level nature. The learning process propagates top-down through the underlying network from the macro level (the entire learning system), to meso level (learning tasks), and to micro level (individual learning examples). In the meanwhile, the networked prediction setting also offers rich context to explain the learning process through the lens of \em multi-aspect, including training examples ( e.g., what are the most influential examples ), the learning tasks ( e.g., which tasks are most important ) and the task network ( e.g., which task connections are the keys ). Thus, we propose a multi-aspect, multi-level approach to explain networked prediction. The key idea is to efficiently quantify the influence on different levels of the learning system due to the perturbation of various aspects. The proposed method offers two distinctive advantages: (1) multi-aspect, multi-level: it is able to explain networked prediction from multiple aspects (i.e., example-task-network) at multiple levels (i.e., macro-meso-micro); (2) efficiency: it has a linear complexity by efficiently evaluating the influences of changes to the networked prediction without retraining.

Melisachew Wudage Chekol:Heiner Stuckenschmidt	There is an ever increasing number of rule learning algorithms and tools for automatic knowledge base (KB) construction. These tools often produce weighted rules and facts that make up a probabilistic KB (PKB). In such a PKB, probabilistic inference is used in order to perform marginal inference, consistency checking and other tasks. However, in general, inference is known to be intractable. Hence, recently, there are a number of studies aimed at lifting (making tractable or approximating) inference by exploiting symmetries in the structure of a PKB. These studies alleviate grounding entirely a given PKB which can generate a sizable factor graph for inference (e.g. to compute the probability of a query). In line with this, we propose a novel technique to automatically partition rules based on their structure for efficient parallel grounding. In addition, we perform query expansion so as to generate a factor graph small enough to be used for efficient probability computation. We present a novel approximate marginal inference algorithm that uses N-hop subgraph extraction and query expansion. Moreover, we show that our system is much faster than state-of-the-art systems.

François Role:Stanislas Morbieu:Mohamed Nadif	Text clustering, which allows to divide a dataset into groups of similar documents, plays an important role at various stages of the information retrieval process. Co-clustering is an extension of one-side clustering, and consists in simultaneously clustering the rows and columns of a data matrix. However, while co-clustering algorithms consider both dimensions of a document-term matrix, they are usually evaluated on the quality of the obtained document clusters alone. In this paper, we therefore propose an evaluation scheme that accounts for the two-dimensional nature of co-clustering algorithms, thus allowing for a more precise evaluation of their performance. Another important benefit of the proposed approach is that it does not require the use of any prior labels. This is achieved by leveraging large, public domain embedding matrices (GloVe, word2vec, FastText) to compute comparable representations of both document and term clusters. Experiments carried out on several textual datasets show that the proposed measures are both reliable and stable, and can even provide hints to improve co-clustering performance.

Xing Gao:Wenli Ji:Yongjun Li:Yao Deng:Wei Dong	User Identification with Spatio-Temporal awareness has been attracting much attention from academia. The existing methods not only handle temporal and spatial data separately but also do not consider conflictive check-in records. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel approach that consists of three parts. 1) Measure the similarity of users with a kernel density estimation based method, which handles the spatial and temporal data together; 2) Assign weights to check-in records following the idea of TFIDF, which highlights the discriminative check-in records; 3) Penalize the similarity of users based on the number of conflictive check-in records. The pair-wise users with similarity higher than a predefined threshold are considered to belong to the same individual. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.

Dwaipayan Roy:Debasis Ganguly:Sumit Bhatia:Srikanta Bedathur:Mandar Mitra	Neural word embedding approaches, due to their ability to capture semantic meanings of vocabulary terms, have recently gained attention of the information retrieval (IR) community and have shown promising results in improving ad hoc retrieval performance. It has been observed that these approaches are sensitive to various choices made during the learning of word embeddings and their usage, often leading to poor reproducibility. We study the effect of varying following two parameters, viz., i) the term normalization and ii) the choice of training collection, on ad hoc retrieval performance with word2vec and fastText embeddings. We present quantitative estimates of similarity of word vectors obtained under different settings, and use embeddings based query expansion task to understand the effects of these parameters on IR effectiveness.

Zhitao Wang:Chengyao Chen:Ke Zhang:Yu Lei:Wenjie LI	Session-based recommendation performance has been significantly improved by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). However, existing RNN-based models do not expose the global knowledge of frequent click patterns or consider variability of sequential behaviors in sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel Variational Recurrent Model (VRM), which employs the stochastic latent variable to capture the knowledge of frequent click patterns and impose variability for the sequential behavior modeling. A stochastic generative process of session sequence is specified, where the latent variable modulates the generation of session sequences in RNN. We further extend VRM to a Conditional Variational Recurrent Model (CVRM) by considering additional information (e.g., focused category in sessions) as the generative condition. When evaluated on a public benchmark dataset, VRM and its extension clearly demonstrate their superiority over popular baselines and state-of-the-art models.

Fan Zhou:Bangying Wu:Yi Yang:Goce Trajcevski:Kunpeng Zhang:Ting Zhong	Recent advances in network representation learning have enabled significant improvements in the link prediction task, which is at the core of many downstream applications. As an increasing amount of mobility data becoming available due to the development of location technologies, we argue that this resourceful user mobility data can be used to improve link prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel link prediction framework that utilizes user offline check-in behavior combined with user online social relations. We model user offline location preference via probabilistic factor model and represent user social relations using neural network embedding. Furthermore, we employ locality-sensitive hashing to project the aggregated user representation into a binary matrix, which not only preserves the data structure but also speeds up the followed convolutional network learning. By comparing with several baseline methods that solely rely on social network or mobility data, we show that our unified approach significantly improves the performance.	vec2Link: Unifying Heterogeneous Data for Social Link Prediction	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018
Tuan-Anh Hoang:Khoi Duy Vo:Wolfgang Nejdl	Topic detection and tracking in document streams is a critical task in many important applications, hence has been attracting research interest in recent decades. With the large size of data streams, there have been a number of works from different approaches that propose automatic methods for the task. However, there is only a few small benchmark datasets that are publicly available for evaluating the proposed methods. The lack of large datasets with fine-grained groundtruth implicitly restrains the development of more advanced methods. In this work, we address this issue by collecting and publishing W2E - a large dataset consisting of news articles from more than 50 prominent mass media channels worldwide. The articles cover a large set of popular events within a full year. W2E is more than 15 times larger than TREC's TDT2 dataset, which is widely used in prior work. We further conduct exploratory analysis to examine the dynamics and diversity of W2E and propose potential uses of the dataset in other research.

Zhuo Li:Hongwei Wang:Miao Zhao	Wireless coverage is the received signal strength of a particular region, which is a key prerequisite to provide high quality mobile communication service. In this paper, we aim to estimate the wireless coverage of an area based on the randomly distributed samples of received signal strength collected within the area. Specifically, we propose a weakly-supervised generative adversarial nets with auxiliary information (WS-GAN), which is a data-driven model to make estimation on the wireless coverage. Different from conventional methods (e.g., k-NN) that predict the missing values by simply replacing them with the average of nearby observations, WS-GAN adopts a GAN-based structure, in which the generator approximates the real distribution of observations under the supervision of the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to distinguish the ground truth from "faked" data produced by the generator. WS-GAN differs from the literature in two aspects: (1) WS-GAN is able to use the auxiliary information of local radio environment, e.g., geographical information as terrain and buildings, to improve the estimation performance, since such auxiliary information has significant impact on the variation of received signal strength. (2) The objective function of WS-GAN combines adversarial loss and a new light-weight reconstruction error term for weakly supervision, which are jointly optimized during training. The experiments on a real dataset show that WS-GAN can generally achieve more accurate results than baselines. Moreover, through a case study, we demonstrate that the wireless coverage maps generated by WS-GAN are more rational and practical than those obtained by baselines.

Dhruv Khattar:Vaibhav Kumar:Vasudeva Varma:Manish Gupta	An effective news recommendation system should harness the historical information of the user based on her interactions as well as the content of the articles. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning model for news recommendation which utilizes the content of the news articles as well as the sequence in which the articles were read by the user. To model both of these information, which are essentially of different types, we propose a simple yet effective architecture which utilizes a 3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network which takes the word embeddings of the articles present in the user history as its input. Using such a method endows the model with the capability to automatically learn spatial (features of a particular article) as well as temporal features (features across articles read by a user) which signify the interest of the user. At test time, we use this in combination with a 2-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for recommending articles to users. On a real-world dataset our method outperformed strong baselines which also model the news recommendation problem using neural networks.

Qianqian Wang:Si Li:Guang Chen	Recently, convolutional neural networks(CNNs) has been demonstrated to effectively model reviews in recommender systems, due to the learning of contextual features such as surrounding words and word order for reviews. However, CNNs with max-pooling fails to capture the count information of contextual features, since the feature map generated by a convolution filter can only get a max feature value with max-pooling. If the max feature value appears more than once in the feature map, CNNs will lose the count information of the contextual feature. The count information is quite critical for modeling reviews, for example, ten "a good quality" is more credible than one "a good quality" for representing item properties, and five "the scenery is" shows that a user may pay more attention to the scenery than one "the scenery is" does. Our model, called WCN-MF, extends CNNs by introducing a new module named Deep Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) to capture the count information of contextual features. DLDA is inspired by the fact that contextual features consist of words, hence, we can first capture the count information of words, and second generate contextual features with words. By combining DLDA with CNNs, we can get a word-driven and context-aware review representation. Further, we incorporate the review representation with Matrix Factorization for recommendation. Our evaluations on three real- world datasets reveal that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation models.

Ariyam Das:Sahil M. Gandhi:Carlo Zaniolo	The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the recent focus on a gamut of 'Smart City' initiatives world-wide have pushed for new advances in data stream systems to (1) support complex analytics and evolving graph applications as continuous queries, and (2) deliver fast and scalable processing on large data streams. Unfortunately current continuous query languages (CQL) lack the features and constructs needed to support the more advanced applications. For example recursive queries are now part of SQL, Datalog, and other query languages, but they are not supported by most CQLs, a fact that caused a significant loss of expressive power, which is further aggravated by the limitation that only non-blocking queries can be supported. To overcome these limitations we have developed an a dvanced st ream r easo ning system ASTRO that builds on recent advances in supporting aggregates in recursive queries. In this demo, we will briefly elucidate the formal Streamlog semantics, which combined with the Pre-Mappability (PreM) concept, allows the declarative specification of many complex continuous queries, which are then efficiently executed in real-time by the portable ASTRO architecture. Using different case studies, we demonstrate (i) the ease-of-use, (ii) the expressive power and (iii) the robustness of our system, as compared to other state-of-the-art declarative CQL systems.

Jan Kristof Nidzwetzki:Ralf Hartmut Güting	BBoxDB is a distributed and highly available key-bounding-box-value store which enhances the classical key-value data model with an axis-parallel bounding box. The bounding box describes the location of the values in an n-dimensional space, and enables BBoxDB to efficiently distribute multi-dimensional data across a cluster of nodes. Well-known geometric algorithms (such as the K-D Tree) are used to create distribution regions (multi-dimensional shards). Distribution regions are created dynamically, based on the stored data. BBoxDB stores data of multiple tables co-partitioned, which enables efficient distributed spatial joins. Spatial joins on co-partitioned tables can be executed without data shuffling between nodes. A two-level index structure is employed to retrieve stored data quickly. We demonstrate the interaction with the system, the dynamic creation of distribution regions and the data redistribution feature of BBoxDB.

Auditors or journalists, e.g., who are looking for irregular or inappropriate content or suspicious patterns, are in desperate need for computer-aided exploration tools to support their investigations. We present our Beacon system for the exploration of such corpora at different levels of detail. A distributed processing pipeline combines text mining methods and social network analysis to augment the already semi-structured nature of emails. The user interface ties into the resulting cleaned and enriched dataset. For the interface design we identify three objectives expert users have: gain an initial overview of the data to identify leads to investigate, understand the context of the information at hand, and have meaningful filters to iteratively focus onto a subset of emails. To this end we make use of interactive visualisations based on rearranged and aggregated extracted information to reveal salient patterns.

Po-Ruey Lei:Li-Pin Xiao:Yu-Ting Wen:Wen-Chih Peng	The improvement of collision avoidance for ship navigation in encounter situation is an important topic in maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path for a ship to keep away from the approaching ship under the requirements of the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). However, the specific anti-collision actions are actually carried out by the navigators' own experience according to the local encounter situation. In this paper, different from the existing works, we discover the collision avoidance behavior from real ships' movement, i.e., AIS trajectory data. However, the uncertainty of maritime trajectory data brings the challenge of collision avoidance behavior mining. ollision behavior, which is effective in the encounter situation, and generate the discovered behavior in form of collision avoidance pattern. Furthermore, a prototype of CAPatternMiner is built for pattern analysis and visualization and also benefits a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior on maritime traffic. The proposed framework will be applied to the developing of pattern-aware collision avoidance system to improve the maritime traffic safety.

Daniel Deutch:Nave Frost	Explaining the results of data-intensive computation via provenance has been extensively studied in the literature. We focus here on explaining the output of Machine Learning Classifiers, which are main components of many contemporary Data Science applications. We have developed a simple generic approach for explaining classification results, by looking for constrained perturbations to parts of the input that would have the most significant effect on the classification. Our solution requires white-box access to the model internals and a specification of constraints that define which perturbations are "reasonable" in the application domain; both are typically available to the data scientist. We propose to demonstrate CEC, a system prototype that is based on these foundations to provide generic explanations for Neural Networks and Random Forests. We will demonstrate the system usefulness in the context of two application domains: bank marketing campaigns, and visually clear explanations for image classifications. We will highlight the benefit that such explanations could yield to the data scientist and interactively engage the audience in computing and viewing explanations for different cases and different sets of constraints.

Michael Loster:Felix Naumann:Jan Ehmueller:Benjamin Feldmann	The integration of diverse structured and unstructured information sources into a unified, domain-specific knowledge base is an important task in many areas. A well-maintained knowledge base enables data analysis in complex scenarios, such as risk analysis in the financial sector or investigating large data leaks, such as the Paradise or Panama papers. Both the creation of such knowledge bases, as well as their continuous maintenance and curation involves many complex tasks and considerable manual effort. With CurEx, we present a modular system that allows structured and unstructured data sources to be integrated into a domain-specific knowledge base. In particular, we (i) enable the incremental improvement of each individual integration component; (ii) enable the selective generation of multiple knowledge graphs from the information contained in the knowledge base; and (iii) provide two distinct user interfaces tailored to the needs of data engineers and end-users respectively. The former has curation capabilities and controls the integration process, whereas the latter focuses on the exploration of the generated knowledge graph.

Stefano Ceri:Arif Canakoglu:Andrea Gulino:Abdulrahman Kaitoua:Marco Masseroli:Luca Nanni:Pietro Pinoli	In the last ten years, genomic computing has made gigantic steps due to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a high-throughput, massively parallel technology; the cost of producing a complete human sequence dropped to 1000 US$ in 2015 and is expected to drop below 100 US$ by 2020. Several new methods have recently become available for extracting heterogeneous datasets from the genome, revealing data signals such as variations from a reference sequence, levels of expression of coding regions, or protein binding enrichments ('peaks') with their statistical or geometric properties. Huge collections of such datasets are made available by large international consortia. In this new context, we developed GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL), a new data extraction and integration language. GMQL supports queries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets; as such, it is key to genomic data analysis. GMQL queries are executed on the cloud, after being translated and optimized; our best deployment uses Spark over Hadoop. Datasets are described by the Genomic Data Model (GDM), which provides interoperability between many data formats; GDM combines abstractions for genomic region data with the associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata. GMQL is targeted to the bio-informatics community for facilitating data exploration and for integrating data extraction and data analysis; this demonstration highlights its usability and expressive power. We show GMQL at work from a Web-based user interface and from a language embedding (Python).	Demonstration of GenoMetric Query Language	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018
Tabassum Kakar:Xiao Qin:Andrew Schade:Brian McCarthy:Huy Quoc Tran:Brian Zylich:Elke Rundensteiner:Lane Harrison:Sanjay K. Sahoo:Suranjan De	Drug-drug interaction related adverse events (DIAE) signals are a major public health issue. Drug safety analysts must sift through thousands of adverse event reports submitted daily to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discover unexpected DIAE signals, which if addressed can lead to life-saving actions. To facilitate the DIAE discovery from these massive data sets, we design several technological innovations that together are integrated into an interactive visual analytics system called DEVES 1. First, our state- of-the-art DIAE mining algorithm efficiently infers potential DIAE signals from these reports, and then ranks them based on their significance score. For interpretability of these inferred DIAE signals, domain knowledge of adverse events and already known drug interactions is extracted from external authoritative data sources and then seamlessly integrated with the inferred signal set. Guided by this augmented signal model, DEVES supports advanced signal analytics - empowering the analyst to interact with linked visualizations offering complementary perspectives into the signal set and its supporting evidence in the form of reports. Our demonstration showcases the technological innovations of DEVES using real-world FDA datasets, demonstrating that DEVES effectively supports the core regulatory tasks from signal screening, signal prioritization to signal validation.

In this paper we present a system called I4TSRS1, available as a Web Application, that efficiently guides a data engineer in the task of obtaining industrial time-series data reduced representations that preserve their main characteristics. Dealing with those reduced representations, data storage and transmission costs can be decreased, without limiting the future exploitation of the data in different processes. The novel contribution of the I4TSRS is that it is an intelligent system that recommends the best techniques to achieve a reduced representation of time-series captured in industrial settings. Its core element is a machine learning model that combines time-series reduction techniques with extracted features from industrial time-series.

Shay Gershtein:Tova Milo:Brit Youngmann:Gal Zeevi	Influence Maximization (IM) is the problem of finding a set of influential users in a social network, so that their aggregated influence is maximized. IM has natural applications in viral marketing and has been the focus of extensive recent research. One critical problem, however, is that while existing IM algorithms serve the goal of reaching a large audience, they may obliviously focus on certain well-connected populations, at the expense of key demographics, creating an undesirable imbalance, an illustration of a broad phenomenon referred to as algorithmic discrimination. Indeed, we demonstrate an inherent trade-off between two objectives: (1) maximizing the overall influence and (2) maximizing influence over a predefined "protected" demographic, with the optimal balance between the two being open to different interpretations. To this end, we present IM-Balanced, a system enabling end users to declaratively specify the desired trade-off between these objectives w.r.t. an emphasized population. IM-Balanced provides theoretical guarantees for the proximity to the optimal solution in terms of both objectives and ensures an efficient, scalable computation via careful adaptation of existing state-of-the-art IM algorithms. Our demonstration illustrates the effectiveness of our approach through real-life viral marketing scenarios in an academic social network.

Daniel Deutch:Yehonatan Ginzberg:Tova Milo	The collaboration of financial institutes against fraudsters is a promising path for reducing resource investments and increasing coverage. Yet, such collaboration is held back by two somewhat conflicting challenges: effective knowledge sharing and limiting leakage of private information. While the censorship of private information is likely to reduce knowledge sharing effectiveness, the generalization of private information to a desired degree can potentially allow, on one hand, to limit the leakage, and on the other hand, to reveal some properties of the private information that can be beneficial for sharing. In this demo we present a system that allows knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules while preserving privacy. The system uses taxonomies to generalize concrete values appearing in fraud detection rules to higher level concepts which conform to some privacy/utility requirements set by the owner. Our demonstration will engage the CIKM'18 audience by showing that private information can be abstracted to enforce privacy while maintaining its usage by (partially) trusted allies.

Harrisen Scells:Guido Zuccon	We present an open source tool, searchrefiner, for researchers that conduct medical systematic reviews to assist in formulating, visualising, and understanding Boolean queries. The searchrefiner web interface allows researchers to explore how Boolean queries retrieve citations in existing, popular query syntaxes used in systematic review literature search. The web interface allows researchers to perform tasks such as using validation citations to ensure queries are retrieving a minimum set of known relevant citations, and editing Boolean queries by dragging and dropping clauses in a structured editor. In addition, the tools provided by the searchrefiner interface allow researchers to visualise why the queries they formulate retrieve citations, and ways to understand how to refine queries into more effective ones. searchrefiner is targeted at both experts and novices, as a tool for query formulation and refinement, and as a tool for training users to search for literature to compile systematic reviews. The searchrefiner website located at https://ielab.io/searchrefiner contains information about how to download, install, and use the tool, as well as a link to an online hosted version for demonstration purposes.	searchrefiner: A Query Visualisation and Understanding Tool for Systematic Reviews	NA:NA	2018
Issac Buenrostro:Abhishek Tiwari:Vasanth Rajamani:Erman Pattuk:Zhixiong Chen	Strong member privacy in technology enterprises involves, among other objectives, deleting or anonymizing various kinds of data that a company controls. Those requirements are complicated in a heterogeneous data ecosystem where data is stored in multiple stores with different semantics: different indexing or update capabilities require processes specific to a store or even schema. In this demo we showcase a method to enforce record controls of arbitrary data stores via a three step process: generate an offline snapshot, run a policy mechanism to select rows to delete/update, and apply the changes to the original store. The first and third steps work on any store by leveraging Apache Gobblin, an open source data integration framework. The policy computation step runs as a batch Gobblin job where each table can be customized via a dataset metadata tracking system and SQL expressions providing table-specific business logic. This setup allows enforcement of highly-customizable privacy requirements in a variety of systems from hosted databases to third party data storage systems.

The SOURCERY system supports interactive multi-criteria user-driven source selection. SOURCERY allows a user to identify criteria they consider of importance and indicate their relative importance, and seeks a source selection result aligned to the user-supplied criteria preferences. The user is given an overview of the properties of the sources that are selected along with visual analyses contextualizing the result in relation to what is theoretically possible and what is possible given the set of available sources. The system also enables a user to interactively perform iterative fine-tuning to explore how changes to preferences may impact results.

Oleksandra Levchenko:Djamel-Edine Yagoubi:Reza Akbarinia:Florent Masseglia:Boyan Kolev:Dennis Shasha	A growing number of domains (finance, seismology, internet-of-things, etc.) collect massive time series. When the number of series grow to the hundreds of millions or even billions, similarity queries become intractable on a single machine. Further, naive (quadratic) parallelization won't work well. So, we need both efficient indexing and parallelization. We propose a demonstration of Spark-parSketch, a complete solution based on sketches / random projections to efficiently perform both the parallel indexing of large sets of time series and a similarity search on them. Because our method is approximate, we explore the tradeoff between time and precision.

Agus Trisnajaya Kwee:Meng-Fen Chiang:Philips Kokoh Prasetyo:Ee-Peng Lim	As road transportation supports both economic and social activities in developed cities, it is important to maintain smooth traffic on all highways and local roads. Whenever possible, traffic congestions should be detected early and resolved quickly. While existing traffic monitoring dashboard systems have been put in place in many cities, these systems require high-cost vehicle speed monitoring instruments and detect traffic congestion as independent events. There is a lack of low-cost dashboards to inspect and analyze the lifecycle of traffic congestion which is critical in assessing the overall impact of congestion, determining the possible the source(s) of congestion and its evolution. In the absence of publicly available sophisticated road sensor data which measures on-road vehicle speed, we make use of publicly available vehicle trajectory data to detect the lifecycle of traffic congestion, also known as congestion cascade. We have developed Traffic-Cascade, a dashboard system to identify traffic congestion events, compile them into congestion cascades, and visualize them on a web dashboard. Traffic-Cascade unveils spatio-temporal insights of the congestion cascades.

Jian Kang:Scott Freitas:Haichao Yu:Yinglong Xia:Nan Cao:Hanghang Tong	In this paper we present a web-based prototype for an explainable ranking algorithm in multi-layered networks, incorporating both network topology and knowledge information. While traditional ranking algorithms such as PageRank and HITS are important tools for exploring the underlying structure of networks, they have two fundamental limitations in their efforts to generate high accuracy rankings. First, they are primarily focused on network topology, leaving out additional sources of information (e.g. attributes, knowledge). Secondly, most algorithms do not provide explanations to the end-users on why the algorithm gives the specific ranking results, hindering the usability of the ranking information. We developed Xrank, an explainable ranking tool, to address these drawbacks. Empirical results indicate that our explainable ranking method not only improves ranking accuracy, but facilitates user understanding of the ranking by exploring the top influential elements in multi-layered networks. The web-based prototype (Xrank: http://www.x-rank.net) is currently online - we believe it will assist both researchers and practitioners looking to explore and exploit multi-layered network data.

The DigitalSelf project at Rutgers University focuses on developing tools and techniques to manage (organize, search, summarize, make inferences on and personalize) such heterogeneous collections of personal digital traces. We propose to demonstrate YourDigitalSelf, a mobile phone-based personal information organization application developed as part of the DigitalSelf project. The demonstration will use a sample user data set to show how several disparate data traces can be integrated and combined to create personal narratives, or coherent episodes, of the user's activities.

Mayur Patidar:Puneet Agarwal:Lovekesh Vig:Gautam Shroff	Helpdesk is a key component of any large IT organization, where users can log a ticket about any issue they face related to IT infrastructure, administrative services, human resource services, etc. Normally, users have to assign appropriate set of labels to a ticket so that it could be routed to right domain expert who can help resolve the issue. In practice, the number of labels are very large and organized in form of a tree. It is non-trivial to describe the issue completely and attach appropriate labels unless one knows the cause of the problem and the related labels. Sometimes domain experts discuss the issue with the users and change the ticket labels accordingly, without modifying the ticket description. This results in inconsistent and badly labeled data, making it hard for supervised algorithms to learn from. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating a conversational helpdesk system, which will ask relevant questions to the user, for identification of the right category and will then raise a ticket on users' behalf. We use attention based seq2seq model to assign the hierarchical categories to tickets. We use a slot filling model to help us decide what questions to ask to the user, if the top-k model predictions are not consistent. We also present a novel approach to generate training data for the slot filling model automatically based on attention in the hierarchical classification model. We demonstrate via a simulated user that the proposed approach can give us a significant gain in accuracy on ticket-data without asking too many questions to users. Finally, we also show that our seq2seq model is as versatile as other approaches on publicly available datasets, as state of the art approaches.

Cheng Cao:Zhengzhang Chen:James Caverlee:Lu-An Tang:Chen Luo:Zhichun Li	Community detection in complex networks is a fundamental problem that attracts much attention across various disciplines. Previous studies have been mostly focusing on external connections between nodes (i.e., topology structure) in the network whereas largely ignoring internal intricacies (i.e., local behavior) of each node. A pair of nodes without any interaction can still share similar internal behaviors. For example, in an enterprise information network, compromised computers controlled by the same intruder often demonstrate similar abnormal behaviors even if they do not connect with each other. In this paper, we study the problem of community detection in enterprise information networks, where large-scale internal events and external events coexist on each host. The discovered host communities, capturing behavioral affinity, can benefit many comparative analysis tasks such as host anomaly assessment. In particular, we propose a novel community detection framework to identify behavior-based host communities in enterprise information networks, purely based on large-scale heterogeneous event data. We continue proposing an efficient method for assessing host's anomaly level by leveraging the detected host communities. Experimental results on enterprise networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Ying Lin:Zhengzhang Chen:Cheng Cao:Lu-An Tang:Kai Zhang:Wei Cheng:Zhichun Li	Given a large number of low-quality heterogeneous categorical alerts collected from an anomaly detection system, how to characterize the complex relationships between different alerts and deliver trustworthy rankings to end users? While existing techniques focus on either mining alert patterns or filtering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider the two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and better understand abnormal system behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a collaborative alert ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content correlations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a hierarchical Bayesian model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in each alert sequence. Then, an entity embedding-based model is proposed to learn the content correlations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes. Finally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into a unified optimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert patterns. Our experiments-using both synthetic and real-world enterprise security alert data-show that CAR can accurately identify true positive alerts and successfully reconstruct the attack scenarios at the same time.

Vachik S. Dave:Baichuan Zhang:Mohammad Al Hasan:Khalifeh AlJadda:Mohammed Korayem	Job recommendation is an important task for the modern recruitment industry. An excellent job recommender system not only enables to recommend a higher paying job which is maximally aligned with the skill-set of the current job, but also suggests to acquire few additional skills which are required to assume the new position. In this work, we created three types of information net- works from the historical job data: (i) job transition network, (ii) job-skill network, and (iii) skill co-occurrence network. We provide a representation learning model which can utilize the information from all three networks to jointly learn the representation of the jobs and skills in the shared k-dimensional latent space. In our experiments, we show that by jointly learning the representation for the jobs and skills, our model provides better recommendation for both jobs and skills. Additionally, we also show some case studies which validate our claims.	A Combined Representation Learning Approach for Better Job and Skill Recommendation	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018
Chen Chu:Zhao Li:Beibei Xin:Fengchao Peng:Chuanren Liu:Remo Rohs:Qiong Luo:Jingren Zhou	Matching buyers with most suitable sellers providing relevant items (e.g., products) is essential for e-commerce platforms to guarantee customer experience. This matching process is usually achieved through modeling inter-group (buyer-seller) proximity by e-commerce ranking systems. However, current ranking systems often match buyers with sellers of various qualities, and the mismatch is detrimental to not only buyers' level of satisfaction but also the platforms' return on investment (ROI). In this paper, we address this problem by incorporating intra-group structural information (e.g., buyer-buyer proximity implied by buyer attributes) into the ranking systems. Specifically, we propose De ep Gr aph E mbe dding (DEGREE), a deep learning based method, to exploit both inter-group and intra-group proximities jointly for structural learning. With a sparse filtering technique, DEGREE can significantly improve the matching performance with computation resources less than that of alternative deep learning based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that DEGREE outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on real-world e-commence datasets. In particular, our solution boosts the average unit price in purchases during an online A/B test by up to 11.93%, leading to better operational efficiency and shopping experience.

Felix Biessmann:David Salinas:Sebastian Schelter:Philipp Schmidt:Dustin Lange	The success of applications that process data critically depends on the quality of the ingested data. Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.

Mobile applications often authenticate the user only at install time. The user may then remain logged in for hours or weeks. Any unauthorized access may lead to financial, criminal or privacy losses. In this work, we leverage currently available built-in motion sensors in smartphones to learn users' behavioral characteristics while interacting with the mobile device to provide an implicit re-authentication mechanism that enables a frictionless and secure user experience in the application. This approach improves the generality as well as power efficiency of the authentication mechanism compared to using the camera feed which involves (a) specific hardware, (b) higher battery usage and (c) privacy concerns. We present DeepAuth as a generic framework for re-authenticating users in a mobile app. In our approach, we use time and frequency domain features extracted from motion sensors and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model with negative sampling to build a re-authentication framework. The framework is able to re-authenticate a user with 96.70% accuracy in 20 seconds from a set of data collected from 47 volunteers.

Beidou Wang:Xin Guo:Martin Ester:Ziyu Guan:Bandeep Singh:Yu Zhu:Jiajun Bu:Deng Cai	With over 34 billion IoT devices to be installed by 2020, the Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally changing our lives. One of the greatest benefits of the IoT is the powerful automations achieved by applying rules to IoT devices. For instance, a rule named "Make me a cup of coffee when I wake up'' automatically turns on the coffee machine when the sensor in the bedroom detects motion in the morning. With large numbers of possible rules out there, a recommendation system is of great necessity to help users find rules they need. However, little effort has been made to design a model tailored for the IoT rule recommendation, which comes with lots of new challenges compared with traditional recommendation tasks. We not only need to re-define "users'' and "items'' in the recommendation task, but also have to consider a new type of entities, devices, and the extra information and constraints brought by them. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel efficient recommendation algorithm, which not only considers the implicit feedback of users on rules, but also takes user-rule-device interactions and the match between rule device requirements and user device possessions into account. In collaboration with Samsung, one of the leading companies in this field, we have designed an IoT rule recommendation framework and evaluated our algorithm on a real-life industry dataset. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.	Device-Aware Rule Recommendation for the Internet of Things	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018
Yaochen Hu:Di Niu:Jianming Yang	User action modeling and prediction has long been a topic of importance to recommender systems and user profiling. The quality of the model or accuracy of prediction plays a vital role in related applications like recommendation, advertisement displaying, searching, etc. For large scale systems with a massive number of users, beside the pure prediction performance, there are other practical factors like training and prediction latency, memory overhead, that must be optimized to ensure smooth operation of the system. We propose a fast linear computational framework to handle a vast number of second order crossed features with dimensionality reduction. By leveraging the training and serving system architecture, we shift heavy calculation burden from online serving to offline preprocessing, at the cost of a reasonable amount of memory overhead. The experiments on a 15-day data trace from Tencent MyApp shows that our proposed framework can achieve comparable prediction performance to much complex models like the field-aware factorization machine (FFM) while being served in 2 ms with a reasonable amount of memory overhead.

Jingyuan Zhang:Xin Wang:Yue Feng:Mingming Sun:Ping Li	Mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) play a crucial role in our daily lives nowadays. People rely heavily on mobile devices for searching online, sending emails, chatting with friends, etc. As a result, input efficiency becomes increasingly important for real-time communication on mobile devices. Due to the small size of the screen on mobile devices, however, it is oftentimes frustrating for users to correct or update the input sequences on an even smaller input area on the screen. This often causes poor user experience. In this paper, we focus on improving the input efficiency on mobile devices to offer better user experience. In order to achieve efficient input, there are multiple challenges: 1) how to employ a single, unified representation of the keyboard layouts for different input languages; 2) how to build a framework to correct a mistouch immediately and predict the coming input texts (words or phrases) effectively; 3) how to deploy and evaluate the model on mobile devices with limited computational power. To address these challenges, we introduce \em FastInput to improve the user input efficiency on mobile devices. Three key techniques are developed in FastInput -- layout modeling, instant mistouch correction and user input text prediction. We also design solutions for efficient deployment and evaluation of FastInput on mobile devices. The proposed FastInput achieves higher efficiency compared to the traditional input system over millions of user input sequences in different languages.

Miao Fan:Wutao Lin:Yue Feng:Mingming Sun:Ping Li	Paraphrase identification (PI) aims at determining whether two natural language sentences roughly have identical meaning. PI has been conventionally formalized as a binary classification task and widely used in many talks such as text summarization, plagiarism detection, etc. The emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) renovates and dominates the learning paradigm of PI, as DNNs do not rely on lexical nor syntactic knowledge of a language, unlike traditional methods. State-of-the-art DNNs-based approaches to PI mainly adopt multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model paraphrastic sentences, which could discover alignments of phrases with the same length (unigram-to-unigram, bigram-to-bigram, trigram-to-trigram, etc.) at each layer. However, paraphrasing phenomena globally exist at all levels of granularity between a pair of paraphrastic sentences, i.e., word-to-word, word-to-phrase, phrase-to-phrase, and even sentence-to-sentence. In this paper, we contribute a globalization-semantic matching neural network (GSMNN) paradigm which has been deployed in Baidu.com to tackle practical PI problems. Established on a weight-sharing single-layer CNN, GSMNN is composed of a multi-granular matching layer with the attention mechanism and a sentence-level matching layer. These layers are designed to capture essentially all phenomena of semantic matching. Evaluations are conducted on a public large-scale dataset for PI: Quora-QP which contains more than 400,000 paraphrasing and non-paraphrasing question pairs from Quora.com. Experimental results show that GSMNN outperforms the state-of-the-art model by a substantial margin.	A Globalization-Semantic Matching Neural Network for Paraphrase Identification	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018

Enhancing behavior representations with user behavior images will help understand user's visual preference and improve the accuracy of CTR prediction greatly. So we propose to model user preference jointly with user behavior ID features and behavior images. However, training with user behavior images brings tens to hundreds of images in one sample, giving rise to a great challenge in both communication and computation. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient distributed machine learning paradigm called Advanced Model Server (AMS). With the well-known Parameter Server (PS) framework, each server node handles a separate part of parameters and updates them independently. AMS goes beyond this and is designed to be capable of learning a unified image descriptor model shared by all server nodes which embeds large images into low dimensional high level features before transmitting images to worker nodes. AMS thus dramatically reduces the communication load and enables the arduous joint training process. Based on AMS, the methods of effectively combining the images and ID features are carefully studied, and then we propose a Deep Image CTR Model. Our approach is shown to achieve significant improvements in both online and offline evaluations, and has been deployed in Taobao display advertising system serving the main traffic.

Meng-Fen Chiang:Ee-Peng Lim:Wang-Chien Lee:Tuan-Anh Hoang	The knowledge of all occupied and unoccupied trips made by self-employed drivers are essential for optimized vehicle dispatch by ride-hailing services (e.g., Didi Dache, Uber, Lyft, Grab, etc.). However, the occupancy status of vehicles is not always known to the service operators due to adoption of multiple ride-hailing apps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Learning to INfer Trips (LINT), to infer occupancy of car trips by exploring characteristics of observed occupied trips. Two main research steps, stop point classification and structural segmentation, are included in LINT. In the stop point classification step, we represent a vehicle trajectory as a sequence of stop points, and assign stop points with pick-up, drop-off, and intermediate labels. The classification of vehicle trajectory stop points produces a stop point label sequence. For structural segmentation, we further propose several segmentation algorithms, including greedy segmentation (GS), efficient greedy segmentation (EGS), and dynamic programming-based segmentation (DP) to infer occupied trip from stop point label sequences. Our comprehensive experiments on real vehicle trajectories from self-employed drivers show that (1) the proposed stop point classifier predicts stop point labels with high accuracy, and (2) the proposed segmentation algorithm GS delivers the best accuracy performance with efficient running time.

Sahin Cem Geyik:Vijay Dialani:Meng Meng:Ryan Smith	Previous efforts in recommendation of candidates for talent search followed the general pattern of receiving an initial search criteria and generating a set of candidates utilizing a pre-trained model. Traditionally, the generated recommendations are final, that is, the list of potential candidates is not modified unless the user explicitly changes his/her search criteria. In this paper, we are proposing a candidate recommendation model which takes into account the immediate feedback of the user, and updates the candidate recommendations at each step. This setting also allows for very uninformative initial search queries, since we pinpoint the user's intent due to the feedback during the search session. To achieve our goal, we employ an intent clustering method based on topic modeling which separates the candidate space into meaningful, possibly overlapping, subsets (which we call intent clusters) for each position. On top of the candidate segments, we apply a multi-armed bandit approach to choose which intent cluster is more appropriate for the current session. We also present an online learning scheme which updates the intent clusters within the session, due to user feedback, to achieve further personalization. Our offline experiments as well as the results from the online deployment of our solution demonstrate the benefits of our proposed methodology.

Lelkes:Cong Yu:Jiawei Han	Recent years have witnessed a widespread increase of rumor news generated by humans and machines. Therefore, tools for investigating rumor news have become an urgent necessity. One useful function of such tools is to see ways a specific topic or event is represented by presenting different points of view from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose Maester, a novel agreement-aware search framework for investigating rumor news. Given an investigative question, Maester will retrieve related articles to that question, assign and display top articles from agree, disagree, and discuss categories to users. Splitting the results into these three categories provides the user a holistic view towards the investigative question. We build Maester based on the following two key observations: (1) relatedness can commonly be determined by keywords and entities occurring in both questions and articles, and (2) the level of agreement between the investigative question and the related news article can often be decided by a few key sentences. Accordingly, we use gradient boosting tree models with keyword/entity matching features for relatedness detection, and leverage recurrent neural network to infer the level of agreement. Our experiments on the Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset demonstrate up to an order of magnitude improvement of Maester over the original FNC winning solution, for agreement-aware search.

Jiaming Shen:Maryam Karimzadehgan:Michael Bendersky:Zhen Qin:Donald Metzler	User information needs vary significantly across different tasks, and therefore their queries will also differ considerably in their expressiveness and semantics. Many studies have been proposed to model such query diversity by obtaining query types and building query-dependent ranking models. These studies typically require either a labeled query dataset or clicks from multiple users aggregated over the same document. These techniques, however, are not applicable when manual query labeling is not viable, and aggregated clicks are unavailable due to the private nature of the document collection, e.g., in email search scenarios. In this paper, we study how to obtain query type in an unsupervised fashion and how to incorporate this information into query-dependent ranking models. We first develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on truncated SVD and varimax rotation to obtain coarse-to-fine query types. Then, we study three query-dependent ranking models, including two neural models that leverage query type information as additional features, and one novel multi-task neural model that views query type as the label for the auxiliary query cluster prediction task. This multi-task model is trained to simultaneously rank documents and predict query types. Our experiments on tens of millions of real-world email search queries demonstrate that the proposed multi-task model can significantly outperform the baseline neural ranking models, which either do not incorporate query type information or just simply feed query type as an additional feature.

Many companies are building ML pipelines in a unified data processing environment, and leveraging well-tuned numerical optimization packages for obtaining model parameters. However, most existing optimization tools are specifically designed for a single machine setup, and cannot handle vast volume of data. In this work, we build a distributed computing framework towards optimizing generalized linear models with billions of variables. We at first design a new distributed vector to represent data points from extremely large feature space. Then, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach to compute the second order derivatives of loss function, and optimizes model parameters with limited memory requirement. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques can scale up for ML models with billions of variables, and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art systems on a wide range of applications, e.g., ad CTR prediction and rideshare price bidding.

Mark Wilhelm:Ajith Ramanathan:Alexander Bonomo:Sagar Jain:Ed H. Chi:Jennifer Gillenwater	Many recommendation systems produce result sets with large numbers of highly similar items. Diversifying these results is often accomplished with heuristics, which are impoverished models of users' desire for diversity. However, integrating more complex statistical models of diversity into large-scale, mature systems is challenging. Without a good match between the model's definition of diversity and users' perception of diversity, the model can easily degrade users' perception of the recommendations. In this work we present a statistical model of diversity based on determinantal point processes (DPPs). We train this model from examples of user preferences with a simple procedure that can be integrated into large and complex production systems relatively easily. We use an approximate inference algorithm to serve the model at scale, and empirical results on live YouTube homepage traffic show that this model, coupled with a re-ranking algorithm, yields substantial short- and long-term increases in user engagement.

Charles Chen:Sungchul Kim:Hung Bui:Ryan Rossi:Eunyee Koh:Branislav Kveton:Razvan Bunescu	The rapid growth of mobile devices has resulted in the generation of a large number of user behavior logs that contain latent intentions and user interests. However, exploiting such data in real-world applications is still difficult for service providers due to the complexities of user behavior over a sheer number of possible actions that can vary according to time. In this work, a time-aware RNN model, TRNN, is proposed for predictive analysis from user behavior data. First, our approach predicts next user action more accurately than the baselines including the n-gram models as well as two recently introduced time-aware RNN approaches. Second, we use TRNN to learn user embeddings from sequences of user actions and show that overall the TRNN embeddings outperform conventional RNN embeddings. Similar to how word embeddings benefit a wide range of task in natural language processing, the learned user embeddings are general and could be used in a variety of tasks in the digital marketing area. This claim is supported empirically by evaluating their utility in user conversion prediction, and preferred application prediction. According to the evaluation results, TRNN embeddings perform better than the baselines including Bag of Words (BoW), TFIDF and Doc2Vec. We believe that TRNN embeddings provide an effective representation for solving practical tasks such as recommendation, user segmentation and predictive analysis of business metrics.

Krishnaram Kenthapadi:Thanh T. L. Tran	Preserving privacy of users is a key requirement of web-scale analytics and reporting applications, and has witnessed a renewed focus in light of recent data breaches and new regulations such as GDPR. We focus on the problem of computing robust, reliable analytics in a privacy-preserving manner, while satisfying product requirements. We present PriPeARL, a framework for privacy-preserving analytics and reporting, inspired by differential privacy. We describe the overall design and architecture, and the key modeling components, focusing on the unique challenges associated with privacy, coverage, utility, and consistency. We perform an experimental study in the context of ads analytics and reporting at LinkedIn, thereby demonstrating the tradeoffs between privacy and utility needs, and the applicability of privacy-preserving mechanisms to real-world data. We also highlight the lessons learned from the production deployment of our system at LinkedIn.	PriPeARL: A Framework for Privacy-Preserving Analytics and Reporting at LinkedIn	NA:NA	2018
Junqi Jin:Chengru Song:Han Li:Kun Gai:Jun Wang:Weinan Zhang	Real-time advertising allows advertisers to bid for each impression for a visiting user. To optimize specific goals such as maximizing revenue and return on investment (ROI) led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and user's interests, but most importantly require a strategic response with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper, we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers. The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods. Our results show cluster-based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better overall objectives than purely self-interested bidding agents.

Guolei Yang:Ying Cai:Chandan K. Reddy	We introduce a new problem, namely, check-in time prediction where the goal is to predict the time when a given user will check-in to a location of interest. We design a novel Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Point Process (RSTPP) model for check-in time prediction. RSTPP addresses two key challenges: 1) Data scarcity due to uneven distribution of check-ins among users/locations. 2) User trajectories contain valuable information that is ignored by standard temporal point process which only considers historical event times. RSTPP is designed to learn the latent dependencies of event times over both historical events and spatio-temporal information about locations a user visited before check-in to the location of interest. We evaluate RSTPP on several real-world datasets, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art event time predicting techniques. Our work derives a set of practical implications that can benefit a wide spectrum of applications.	Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Check-in Time Prediction	NA:NA:NA	2018
Yuhang Zhang:Kee Siong Ng:Tania Churchill:Peter Christen	Accurate and efficient entity resolution is an open challenge of particular relevance to intelligence organisations that collect large datasets from disparate sources with differing levels of quality and standard. Starting from a first-principles formulation of entity resolution, this paper presents a novel entity resolution algorithm that introduces a data-driven blocking and record linkage technique based on the probabilistic identification of entity signatures in data. The scalability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using benchmark datasets and shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. The proposed algorithm can be implemented simply on modern parallel databases, which we have done in the financial intelligence domain with tens of Terabytes of noisy data.

Evangelos Papalexakis:Konstantinos Pelechrinis	During the past few years advancements in sports information systems and technology has allowed the collection of a number of detailed spatio-temporal data that capture various aspects of basketball. For example, shot charts, that is, maps capturing locations of (made or missed) shots, and spatio-temporal trajectories for the players on the court can capture information about the offensive and defensive tendencies, as well as, schemes used by a team. Characterization of these processes is important for player and team comparisons, scouting, game preparation etc. Team and player tendencies have traditionally been compared in a heuristic manner, which inevitably can lead to subtle but crucial information being ignored. Recently automated ways for these comparisons have appeared in the sports analytics literature. However, these approaches are almost exclusively focused on the spatial distribution of the underlying actions (usually shots taken), ignoring a multitude of other parameters that can affect the action studied. In this study, we propose a framework based on tensor decomposition for obtaining a set of prototype spatio-temporal patterns based on the core spatio-temporal information and contextual meta-data. At the epicenter of our work is a 3D tensor $\tensor$, whose dimensions represent the entity under consideration (team, player, possession etc.), the location on the court and time. We make use of the PARAFAC decomposition and we decompose the tensor into several interpretable patterns, that can be thought of as prototype patterns of the process examined (e.g., shot selection, offensive schemes etc.). We also introduce an approach for choosing the number of components to be considered. Using the tensor components, we can then express every entity as a weighted combination of these components. Finally, the framework introduced in this paper has applications that go beyond purely pattern analysis. In particular, it can facilitate a variety of tasks in the work-flow of a franchise's basketball operations as well as in the sports analytics research community.	tHoops: A Multi-Aspect Analytical Framework for Spatio-Temporal Basketball Data	NA:NA	2018
Anthony Bell:Prathyusha Senthil Kumar:Daniel Miranda	Search relevance is a very critical component in e-commerce applications. One of the strongest signals that determine the relevance of an item listing to an e-commerce query is the title of the item. Traditional methods for capturing this signal compare words in listing titles and the user query using tf-idf scores, or use a machine learned model with words as features and target clicks or relevance labels. Contrary to these approaches, we build a parameterized model to determine the weights of popular title terms for a query and then use these title term weights to compute the relevance of a listing title to the query. For this, we use human judged binary relevance labels of query and item title pairs as labeled data and train a model leveraging a variety of features to learn these query specific title term weights. We propose two novel approaches to model these title term weights using the relevance target and explore several novel features specific to e-commerce for this term weighting model. We use the resulting title relevance score as a feature in eBay's machine learned ranker for e-commerce search serving millions of queries each day. We observe a significant improvement over a baseline click-based binary independence model for capturing item title relevance in several metrics including model accuracy and overall relevance and engagement observed through A/B testing. We also experimentally illustrate that this feature optimized for relevance works well in conjunction with textual features optimized for demand.

Rishabh Mehrotra:James McInerney:Hugues Bouchard:Mounia Lalmas:Fernando Diaz	Two-sided marketplaces are platforms that have customers not only on the demand side (e.g. users), but also on the supply side (e.g. retailer, artists). While traditional recommender systems focused specifically towards increasing consumer satisfaction by providing relevant content to consumers, two-sided marketplaces face the problem of additionally optimizing for supplier preferences, and visibility. Indeed, the suppliers would want afair opportunity to be presented to users. Blindly optimizing for consumer relevance may have a detrimental impact on supplier fairness. Motivated by this problem, we focus on the trade-off between objectives of consumers and suppliers in the case of music streaming services, and consider the trade-off betweenrelevance of recommendations to the consumer (i.e. user) andfairness of representation of suppliers (i.e. artists) and measure their impact on consumersatisfaction. We propose a conceptual and computational framework using counterfactual estimation techniques to understand, and evaluate different recommendation policies, specifically around the trade-off between relevance and fairness, without the need for running many costly A/B tests. We propose a number of recommendation policies which jointly optimize relevance and fairness, thereby achieving substantial improvement in supplier fairness without noticeable decline in user satisfaction. Additionally, we consider user disposition towards fair content, and propose a personalized recommendation policy which takes into account consumer's tolerance towards fair content. Our findings could guide the design of algorithms powering two-sided marketplaces, as well as guide future research on sophisticated algorithms for joint optimization of user relevance, satisfaction and fairness.

Rohan Ramanath:Hakan Inan:Gungor Polatkan:Bo Hu:Qi Guo:Cagri Ozcaglar:Xianren Wu:Krishnaram Kenthapadi:Sahin Cem Geyik	Talent search and recommendation systems at LinkedIn strive to match the potential candidates to the hiring needs of a recruiter or a hiring manager expressed in terms of a search query or a job posting. Recent work in this domain has mainly focused on linear models, which do not take complex relationships between features into account, as well as ensemble tree models, which introduce non-linearity but are still insufficient for exploring all the potential feature interactions, and strictly separate feature generation from modeling. In this paper, we present the results of our application of deep and representation learning models on LinkedIn Recruiter. Our key contributions include: (i) Learning semantic representations of sparse entities within the talent search domain, such as recruiter ids, candidate ids, and skill entity ids, for which we utilize neural network models that take advantage of LinkedIn Economic Graph, and (ii) Deep models for learning recruiter engagement and candidate response in talent search applications. We also explore learning to rank approaches applied to deep models, and show the benefits for the talent search use case. Finally, we present offline and online evaluation results for LinkedIn talent search and recommendation systems, and discuss potential challenges along the path to a fully deep model architecture. The challenges and approaches discussed generalize to any multi-faceted search engine.	Towards Deep and Representation Learning for Talent Search at LinkedIn	NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA	2018
Jianglei Han:Ka Hian Goh:Aixin Sun:Mohammad Akbari	Software support tickets contain short and noisy text from the customers. Software products are often represented by various surface forms and informal abbreviations. Automatically identifying software mentions from support tickets and determining the official names and versions are helpful for many downstream applications, \eg routing the support tickets to the right expert groups for support. In this work, we study the problem ofsoftware product name extraction andlinking from support tickets. We first annotate and analyze sampled tickets to understand the language patterns. Next, we design features using local, contextual, and external information sources, for extraction and linking models. In experiments, we show that linear models with the proposed features are able to deliver better and more consistent results, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline models, even on dataset with sparse labels.

Xijun Li:Jianguo Yao:Mingxuan Yuan:Jia Zeng	Industrial telecommunication applications prefer to run at the optimal capacity configuration to achieve the required Quality of Service (QoS) at the minimum cost. The optimal capacity configuration is usually achieved through the selection of cell towers capacities and locations. Given a set of service providers (e.g., cell towers) and a set of customers (e.g., major residential areas), where each customer has an amount of demand and each provider has multiple candidate capacities and corresponding costs, the optimal capacity selection is configured through spatial matching to satisfy the demand of each customer at the minimum cost. However, existing solutions developed for spatial matching, in which each provider's capacity is fixed, cannot be directly applied to the capacity configuration problem with multiple capacities and location selections. In this paper, we are the first to study Service Provider Configuration and Planning with Optimal Spatial Matching (SPC-POSM) problem, in which the objectives are 1) to select the proper capacity for each provider at the minimum total cost and 2) to assign providers' service to satisfy the demand of each customer on a condition that the matching distance is no more than service quality requirement. We prove that SPC-POSM problem is NP-hard and design an efficient two-layer meta-heuristic framework to solve the problem. Unsupervised learning technique is designed to accelerate the calculation and a novel local search mechanism is embedded to further improve solution quality. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Boris Sharchilev:Michael Roizner:Andrey Rumyantsev:Denis Ozornin:Pavel Serdyukov:Maarten de Rijke	We consider the problem of predicting the success of startup companies at their early development stages. We formulate the task as predicting whether a company that has already secured initial (seed or angel) funding will attract a further round of investment in a given period of time. Previous work on this task has mostly been restricted to mining structured data sources, such as databases of the startup ecosystem consisting of investors, incubators and startups. Instead, we investigate the potential of using web-based open sources for the startup success prediction task and model the task using a very rich set of signals from such sources. In particular, we enrich structured data about the startup ecosystem with information from a business- and employment-oriented social networking service and from the web in general. Using these signals, we train a robust machine learning pipeline encompassing multiple base models using gradient boosting. We show that utilizing companies' mentions on the Web yields a substantial performance boost in comparison to only using structured data about the startup ecosystem. We also provide a thorough analysis of the obtained model that allows one to obtain insights into both the types of useful signals discoverable on the Web and market mechanisms underlying the funding process.

Michalis Vazirgiannis:Fragkiskos D. Malliaros:Giannis Nikolentzos	Graphs have been widely used as modeling tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Mining (TM) and Information Retrieval (IR). Traditionally, the unigram bag-of-words representation is applied; that way, a document is represented as a multiset of its terms, disregarding dependencies between the terms. Although several variants and extensions of this modeling approach have been proposed, the main weakness comes from the underlying term independence assumption; the order of the terms within a document is completely disregarded and any relationship between terms is not taken into account in the final task. To deal with this problem, the research community has explored various representations, and to this direction, graphs constitute a well-developed model for text representation. The goal of this tutorial is to offer a comprehensive presentation of recent methods that rely on graph-based text representations to deal with various tasks in Text Mining, NLP and IR.

Iman Elghandour:Ahmet Kara:Dan Olteanu:Stijn Vansummeren	Many applications from various disciplines are now required to analyze fast evolving big data in real time. Various approaches for incremental processing of queries have been proposed over the years. Traditional approaches rely on updating the results of a query when updates are streamed rather than re-computing these queries, and therefore, higher execution performance is expected. However, they do not perform well for large databases that are updated at high frequencies. Therefore, new algorithms and approaches have been proposed in the literature to address these challenges by, for instance, reducing the complexity of processing updates. Moreover, many of these algorithms are now leveraging distributed streaming platforms such as Spark Streaming and Flink. In this tutorial, we briefly discuss legacy approaches for incremental query processing, and then give an overview of the new challenges introduced due to processing big data streams. We then discuss in detail the recently proposed algorithms that address some of these challenges. We emphasize the characteristics and algorithmic analysis of various proposed approaches and conclude by discussing future research directions.

Jiaheng Lu:Irena Holubová:Bogdan Cautis	One of the most challenging issues in the era of Big Data is the Variety of the data. In general, there are two solutions to directly manage multi-model data currently: a single integrated multi-model database system or a tightly-integrated middleware over multiple single-model data stores. In this tutorial, we review and compare these two approaches giving insights on their advantages, trade-offs, and research opportunities. In particular, we dive into four key aspects of technology for both types of systems, namely (1) theoretical foundation of multi-model data management, (2) storage strategies for multi-model data, (3) query languages across models, and (4) query evaluation and its optimization. We provide a comparison of performance for the two approaches and discuss related open problems and remaining challenges.

Diego Calvanese:Guohui Xiao	Recently, semantic technologies have been successfully deployed to overcome the typical difficulties in accessing and integrating data stored in different kinds of legacy sources. In particular, knowledge graphs are being used as a mechanism to provide a uniform representation of heterogeneous information. Such graphs represent data in the RDF format, which is complemented by an ontology and can be queried using the standard SPARQL language. The RDF graph is often obtained by materializing source data, following the traditional extract-transform-load workflow. Alternatively, the sources are declaratively mapped to the ontology, and the RDF graph is maintained virtual. In such an approach, usually called ontology-based data access/integration (OBDA/I), query answering is based on sophisticated query transformation techniques. In this tutorial: (i) we provide a general introduction to semantic technologies; (ii) we illustrate the principles underlying OBDA/I, providing insights into its theoretical foundations, and describing well-established algorithms, techniques, and tools; (iii) we discuss relevant use-cases for OBDA/I; (iv) we provide an overview on some recent advancements.

Qingyao Ai:Jiaxin Mao:Yiqun Liu:W. Bruce Croft	Implicit feedback (e.g., user clicks) is an important source of data for modern search engines. While heavily biased [8, 9, 11, 27], it is cheap to collect and particularly useful for user-centric retrieval applications such as search ranking. To develop an unbiased learning-to-rank system with biased feedback, previous studies have focused on constructing probabilistic graphical models (e.g., click models) with user behavior hypothesis to extract and train ranking systems with unbiased relevance signals. Recently, a novel counterfactual learning framework that estimates and adopts examination propensity for unbiased learning to rank has attracted much attention. Despite its popularity, there is no systematic comparison of the unbiased learning-to-rank frameworks based on counterfactual learning and graphical models. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an overview of the fundamental mechanism for unbiased learning to rank. We will describe the theory behind existing frameworks, and give detailed instructions on how to conduct unbiased learning to rank in practice.
